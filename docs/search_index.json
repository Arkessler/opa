:"Introduction\nA policy is a set of rules that governs the behavior of a service.\nPolicy-enablement empowers users to read, write, and manage these rules without\nneeding specialized development or operational expertise. When your users can\nimplement policies without recompiling your source code, then your service is\npolicy enabled.\nWhat is Policy?\nAll organizations have policies. Policies are essential to the long-term\nsuccess of organizations because they encode important knowledge about how to\ncomply with legal requirements, work within technical constraints, avoid\nrepeating mistakes, and so on.\nIn their simplest form, policies can be applied manually based on rules that\nare written down or conventions that are unspoken but permeate an\norganization’s culture. Policies may also be enforced with application logic or\nstatically configured at deploy time.\nWhat is Policy Enablement?\nPolicy-enabled services allow policies to be specified declaratively, updated\nat any time without recompiling or redeploying, and enforced automatically\n(which is especially valuable when decisions need to be made faster than\nhumanly possible). They make deployments more adaptable to changing business\nrequirements, improve the ability to discover violations and conflicts,\nincrease the consistency of policy compliance, and mitigate the risk of human\nerror.\nA policy-enabled service is able to answer questions by comparing relevant\ninput from its environment to policy statements written by administrators. For\nexample, a cloud computing service could answer questions such as:\n\nCan I add compute capacity?\nIn what regions can I add compute capacity?\nWhich instances are currently running in the wrong region?\n\nWhat is OPA?\nOPA is a lightweight general-purpose policy engine that can be co-located with\nyour service. You can integrate OPA as a sidecar, host-level daemon, or\nlibrary.\nServices offload policy decisions to OPA by executing queries. OPA evaluates\npolicies and data to produce query results (which are sent back to the client).\nPolicies are written in a high-level declarative language and can be loaded\ninto OPA via the filesystem or well-defined APIs.\nWhy use OPA?\n\n"},"how-does-opa-work.html":{"url":"how-does-opa-work.html","title":"How Does OPA Work?","keywords":"","body":"How Does OPA Work?\nOPA is a full-featured policy engine that offloads policy decisions from your service. You can think of it as a concierge for your service who can answer detailed questions on behalf of your users to meet their specific needs.\nOverview\nOPA’s RESTful APIs use JSON over HTTP so you and your users can integrate OPA with any programming language. At a high level, integrating OPA into your service involves:\n\nDeploying OPA alongside your service\nPushing relevant data about your service’s state into OPA’s document store\nOffloading some or all decision-making to OPA by querying it\n\nWhen your service is integrated with OPA, your users will be able author and deploy custom policies that control the behavior of your service’s policy-enabled features. Furthermore, users can publish data to OPA that is not available to your service about their own deployment context.\n\nIn the future, both your service and its users will be able to register for, and react to, notifications triggered when OPA detects a policy-relevant change.\nDeployment\nUnless you embed OPA as a Go library, you will deploy it alongside your service – either directly as an operating system daemon or inside a container. In this way, transactions will have low latency and availability will be determined through shared fate with your service.\nWhen OPA starts for the first time, it will not contain any policies or data. Policies and data can be added, removed, and modified at any time. For example: by deployment automation software or your service as it is deployed, by your service during an upgrade, or by administrators as needed.\nData and Policies\nThe primary unit of data in OPA is a document, which is similar to a JSON value. Documents typically correspond to single, self-contained objects and are capable of representing both primitive types (strings, numbers, booleans, and null) as well as structured types (objects, and arrays). Documents are created, read, updated, and deleted via OPA’s RESTful HTTP APIs.\n\nBase Documents\nSo-called base documents contain static, structured data stored in memory and optionally saved to disk for resiliency. Your service will publish and update base documents in order to describe its current state, and your users can do the same to include relevant data about the state of their own deployment context.\nBase documents are published and updated using OPA’s Data API. For example, the following request publishes a list of servers to OPA:\nPATCH https://example.com/v1/data/servers HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/json-patch+json\n\n[\n  {\n    \"op\": \"add\",\n    \"path\": \"-\",\n    \"value\": {\n      \"id\": \"s1\",\n      \"name\": \"app\",\n      \"protocols\": [\n        \"http\",\n        \"https\",\n        \"ssh\"\n      ],\n      \"ports\": [\n        \"p1\",\n        \"p2\",\n        \"p3\"\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"op\": \"add\",\n    \"path\": \"-\",\n    \"value\": {\n      \"id\": \"s2\",\n      \"name\": \"db\",\n      \"protocols\": [\n        \"mysql\"\n      ],\n      \"ports\": [\n        \"p3\"\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"op\": \"add\",\n    \"path\": \"-\",\n    \"value\": {\n      \"id\": \"s3\",\n      \"name\": \"cache\",\n      \"protocols\": [\n        \"memcache\"\n      ],\n      \"ports\": [\n        \"p3\"\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"op\": \"add\",\n    \"path\": \"-\",\n    \"value\": {\n      \"id\": \"s4\",\n      \"name\": \"dev\",\n      \"protocols\": [\n        \"http\",\n        \"https\",\n        \"ssh\"\n      ],\n      \"ports\": [\n        \"p1\",\n        \"p2\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n]\n\nPolicies\nPolicies are written using OPA’s purpose-built, declarative language Rego. Rego includes rich support for traversing nested documents and transforming data using syntax inspired by dictionary and array access in languages like Python and JSONPath. For detailed information about using Rego, see How Do I Write Policies?.\nEach Rego file defines a policy module using a collection of rules that describe the expected state of your service. Both your service and its users can publish and update policy modules using OPA’s Policy API. For example, the following request creates a policy with two rules (violations and public_servers) named “exempli-gratia”:\nPUT https://example.com/v1/policies/exempli-gratia HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: text/plain\n\npackage opa.examples\n\nimport data.servers\nimport data.networks\nimport data.ports\n\nviolations[server] {\n    server = servers[_]\n    server.protocols[_] = \"http\"\n    public_servers[server]\n}\n\npublic_servers[server] {\n    server = servers[_]\n    server.ports[_] = ports[i].id\n    ports[i].networks[_] = networks[j].id\n    networks[j].public = true\n}\n\nA policy file must contain a single package declaration, which defines the path to the policy module and its rules (for example, data.opa.examples.violations – see The data Document for more information about accessing nested documents). The policy name itself (in this case, “exempli-gratia”) is only used to identify policies for file management purposes; it is not used otherwise.\nRules and Virtual Documents\nIn contrast to base documents, virtual documents embody the results of evaluating the rules included in policy modules. Virtual documents are computed when users publish new policy modules, update existing modules, run queries, and when any relevant base document is published or updated. Rules allow policy authors to write questions with yes-no answers (that is, predicates) and to generate structured values from raw data found in base documents as well as from intermediate data found in other virtual documents.\nThe data Document\nAll documents pushed into OPA or computed by rules are nested under a built-in root document named data.\n\nExample data document:\n{\n  \"servers\": [...],\n  \"ports\": [...],\n  \"networks\": [...],\n  \"opa\": {\n    \"examples\": {\n      \"violations\": [...],\n      \"public_servers\": [...]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nAs a result, any document, base or virtual, can be accessed hierarchically starting from the root data node – either as an identifier:\nimport data.servers                            # Base document\nimport data.opa.examples.violations            # Virtual document\n\nor as a URI component in an HTTP request:\nGET https://example.com/v1/data/servers HTTP/1.1\n\nGET https://example.com/v1/data/opa/examples/violations HTTP/1.1\n\n\nSince the data document includes both base and virtual documents,\nit is possible to query for both at the same time. The easiest way\nto illustrate this is to query for all of data at once. Note,\nOPA does NOT allow base and virtual documents to overlap. For\nexample, if you try to load a rule that defines a virtual document\nat path a/b/c (which is already defined by a base document), OPA\nwill return an error. Similarly, if you try to load a base document\ninto a path that is already defined by a virtual document, OPA will\nalso return an error.\n\nThe input Document\nIn some cases, policies require input values. In addition to the built-in\ndata document, OPA also has a built-in input document. When you query\nOPA, you can set the value of the input document.\nExample input document:\n{\n    \"method\": \"GET\",\n    \"path\": \"/servers/s2\",\n    \"user\": \"alice\"\n}\n\nThe input document can be referenced just like the data document.\n# Let 'bob' perform read-only operations.\nallow {\n  input.user = \"bob\"\n  input.method = \"GET\"\n}\n\n# Let 'alice' perform any operation.\nallow {\n  input.user = \"alice\"\n}\n\nPutting It All Together\nLet’s take a look at some documents representing the state of a hypothetical service and a policy module that uses this data. The following documents describe a set of servers, the protocols they use, the ports they open, and the networks those ports are connected to.\nExample data document:\n{\n  \"servers\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"s1\",\n      \"name\": \"app\",\n      \"protocols\": [\n        \"https\",\n        \"ssh\"\n      ],\n      \"ports\": [\n        \"p1\",\n        \"p2\",\n        \"p3\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"s2\",\n      \"name\": \"db\",\n      \"protocols\": [\n        \"mysql\"\n      ],\n      \"ports\": [\n        \"p3\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"s3\",\n      \"name\": \"cache\",\n      \"protocols\": [\n        \"memcache\",\n        \"http\"\n      ],\n      \"ports\": [\n        \"p3\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"s4\",\n      \"name\": \"dev\",\n      \"protocols\": [\n        \"http\"\n      ],\n      \"ports\": [\n        \"p1\",\n        \"p2\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"networks\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"n1\",\n      \"public\": false\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"n2\",\n      \"public\": false\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"n3\",\n      \"public\": true\n    }\n  ],\n  \"ports\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"p1\",\n      \"networks\": [\n        \"n1\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"p2\",\n      \"networks\": [\n        \"n3\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"p3\",\n      \"networks\": [\n        \"n2\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nWhen the data is published, we can use OPA’s API to inspect base documents like servers:\nGET https://example.com/v1/data/servers HTTP/1.1\n\nThe response is an object that contains the array of servers:\n{\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"s1\",\n      \"name\": \"app\",\n      \"protocols\": [\n        \"https\",\n        \"ssh\"\n      ],\n      \"ports\": [\n        \"p1\",\n        \"p2\",\n        \"p3\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"s2\",\n      \"name\": \"db\",\n      \"protocols\": [\n        \"mysql\"\n      ],\n      \"ports\": [\n        \"p3\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"s3\",\n      \"name\": \"cache\",\n      \"protocols\": [\n        \"memcache\",\n        \"http\"\n      ],\n      \"ports\": [\n        \"p3\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"s4\",\n      \"name\": \"dev\",\n      \"protocols\": [\n        \"http\"\n      ],\n      \"ports\": [\n        \"p1\",\n        \"p2\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nNow let’s write a policy that enumerates servers that are connected to public networks and that are using HTTP. These servers are violating a business rule that states that all public servers must use HTTPS.\n# This policy module belongs to the opa.examples package.\npackage opa.examples\n\n# Refer to data.servers as `servers`.\nimport data.servers\n# Refer to the data.networks as `networks`.\nimport data.networks\n# Refer to the data.ports as `ports`.\nimport data.ports\n\n# A server exists in the violations set if...\nviolations[server] {\n    # ...the server exists\n    server = servers[_]\n    # ...and any of the server’s protocols is HTTP\n    server.protocols[_] = \"http\"\n    # ...and the server is public.\n    public_servers[server]\n}\n\n# A server exists in the public_servers set if...\npublic_servers[server] {\n    # ...the server exists\n    server = servers[_]\n    # ...and the server is connected to a port\n    server.ports[_] = ports[i].id\n    # ...and the port is connected to a network\n    ports[i].networks[_] = networks[j].id\n    # ...and the network is public.\n    networks[j].public = true\n}\n\nNote that:\n\nRules consist of assertions about data stored in OPA. In this case, the assertions test for equality with, and membership of, values in the servers, networks, and ports documents.\nExpressions can reference elements in a collection using the [_] and [] syntax. OPA knows to evaluate such queries by iterating over each element in the corresponding collection.\nAssertions about elements in a collection are true if any of the elements match the expression, and are only false when none of the elements match. For example, ports[i].networks[_] = networks[j].id will be true whenever any element in ports[i].networks matches the id of any element in networks.\nExpressions can reference nested documents. For example, ports[i].networks[_] refers to each network ID listed in each port document.\nExpressions can reference virtual documents. For example, public_servers[server] = true matches only if server is in the list produced by the public_servers rule.\n\nAfter publishing this policy module, the data document will include\nadditional documents corresponding to the module’s package declaration\n(opa.examples) and the virtual documents its rules generate.\nGET https://example.com/v1/data HTTP/1.1\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  \"result\": {\n    \"servers\": [...],\n    \"networks\": [...],\n    \"ports\": [...],\n    \"opa\": {\n      \"examples\": {\n        \"violations\": [\n          {\n            \"id\": \"s4\",\n            \"name\": \"dev\",\n            \"protocols\": [\n              \"http\"\n            ],\n            \"ports\": [\n              \"p1\",\n              \"p2\"\n            ]\n          }\n        ],\n        \"public_servers\": [\n          {\n            \"id\": \"s1\",\n            \"name\": \"app\",\n            \"protocols\": [\n              \"https\",\n              \"ssh\"\n            ],\n            \"ports\": [\n              \"p1\",\n              \"p2\",\n              \"p3\"\n            ]\n          },\n          {\n            \"id\": \"s4\",\n            \"name\": \"dev\",\n            \"protocols\": [\n              \"http\"\n            ],\n            \"ports\": [\n              \"p1\",\n              \"p2\"\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nIn this case, we are only interested in the set of servers that violate the\npolicy. We can use OPA's API to query for just those servers.\nGET https://example.com/v1/data/opa/examples/violations HTTP/1.1\n\n…the response is the subset of the servers base document that use HTTP and are connected to a public network:\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"s4\",\n      \"name\": \"dev\",\n      \"protocols\": [\n        \"http\"\n      ],\n      \"ports\": [\n        \"p1\",\n        \"p2\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n"},"how-do-i-write-policies.html":{"url":"how-do-i-write-policies.html","title":"How Do I Write Policies?","keywords":"","body":"How Do I Write Policies?\nOPA is purpose built for reasoning about information represented in structured\ndocuments. The data that your service and its users publish can be inspected and\ntransformed using OPA’s native query language Rego.\nWhat is Rego?\nRego was inspired by Datalog, which is\na well understood, decades old query language. Rego extends Datalog to support\nstructured document models such as JSON.\nRego queries are assertions on data stored in OPA. These queries can be used to\ndefine policies that enumerate instances of data that violate the expected state\nof the system.\nWhy use Rego?\nUse Rego for defining policy that is easy to read and write.\nRego focuses on providing powerful support for referencing nested documents and\nensuring that queries are correct and unambiguous.\nRego is declarative so policy authors can focus on what queries should return\nrather than how queries should be executed. These queries are simpler and more\nconcise than the equivalent in an imperative language.\nLike other applications which support declarative query languages, OPA is able\nto optimize queries to improve performance.\nThe Basics\nThis section introduces the main aspects of Rego.\nThe simplest rule is a single expression and is defined in terms of a Scalar Value:\npi = 3.14159\n\nRules define the content of documents. We can query for the content of the pi document generated by the rule above:\n> pi\n3.14159\n\nRules can also be defined in terms of Composite Values:\nrect = {\"width\": 2, \"height\": 4}\n\nThe result:\n> rect\n{\n  \"height\": 4,\n  \"width\": 2\n}\n\nMany expressions are defined in terms of Equality. These expressions can be thought of as assertions. The simplest example of a rule containing an equality expression involves two scalar values:\nv { \"hello\" = \"world\" }\n\nIf we evaluate v on its own, the REPL prints undefined because the body\nof the rule never evaluates to true. As a result, the document generated by\nthe rule is not defined.\n> v\nundefined\n\nExpressions that refer to undefined values are also undefined.\n> v = true\nundefined\n\nThe order of operands in an equality expression does not matter. The result is the same:\n> true = v\nundefined\n\nWe can define rules in terms of Variables as well:\nt { x = 42; y = 41; x > y }\n\nThe formal syntax uses the semicolon character ; to separate expressions. Rule\nbodies can separate expressions with newlines and omit the semicolon:\nt2 {\n    x = 42\n    y = 41\n    x > 1\n}\nWhen evaluating rule bodies, OPA searches for variable bindings that make all of\nthe expressions true. There may be multiple sets of bindings that make the rule\nbody true. The rule body can be understood intuitively as:\nexpression-1 AND expression-2 AND ... AND expression-N\nThe rule itself can be understood intuitively as:\nrule-name IS value IF body\nIf the value is omitted, it defaults to true.\nWhen we query for the contents of t we see the obvious result:\n> t\ntrue\n\nThe order of expressions in a rule does not affect the document’s content:\ns {\n    x > y\n    y = 41\n    x = 42\n}\n\nThe query result is the same:\n> s\ntrue\n\nRego References help you refer to nested documents. For example:\nsites = [{\"name\": \"prod\"}, {\"name\": \"smoke1\"}, {\"name\": \"dev\"}]\n\nr { sites[i].name = \"prod\" }\n\nThe rule r above asserts that there exists (at least) one document within sites where the name attribute equals \"prod\".\nThe result:\n> r\ntrue\n\nWe can generalize the example above with a rule that defines a set document instead of a boolean document:\nq[name] { sites[i].name = name }\n\nWhen we query for q we obtain a set of names:\n> q[x]\n+----------+----------+\n|    x     |   q[x]   |\n+----------+----------+\n| \"prod\"   | \"prod\"   |\n| \"smoke1\" | \"smoke1\" |\n| \"dev\"    | \"dev\"    |\n+----------+----------+\n\nWe can re-write the rule r from above to make use of q. We will call the new rule p:\np { q[\"prod\"] }\n\nThe result will be the same:\n> p\ntrue\n\nRules which have arguments can be queried with input values:\n> q[\"smoke2\"]\nundefined\n> s { q[\"dev\"] }\n> s\ntrue\n\nIf you made it this far, congratulations!\nThis section introduced the main aspects of Rego. The rest of this document\nwalks through each part of the language in more detail.\nFor a concise reference, see the Language\nReference document.\nScalar Values\nScalar values are the simplest type of term in Rego. Scalar values can be Strings, numbers, booleans, or null.\nDocuments can be defined solely in terms of scalar values. This is useful for defining constants that are referenced in multiple places. For example:\ngreeting   = \"Hello\"\nmax_height = 42\npi         = 3.14159\nallowed    = true\nsentinel   = null\n\nThese documents can be queried like any other:\n> greeting\n\"Hello\"\n> max_height\n42\n> pi\n3.14159\n> allowed\ntrue\n> sentinel\nnull\n\nStrings\nRego supports two different types of syntax for declaring strings. The first is likely to be the most familiar: characters surrounded by double quotes.\nIn such strings, certain characters must be escaped to appear in the string, such as double quotes themselves, backslashes, etc. See the Language\nReference for a formal definition.\nThe other type of string declaration is a raw string declaration. These are made of characters surrounded by backticks (` ), with the exception\nthat raw strings may not contain backticks themselves. Raw strings are what they sound like: escape sequences are not interpreted, but instead taken\nas the literal text inside the backticks. For example, the raw string `hello\\there`  will be the text \"hello\\there\", not \"hello\" and \"here\"\nseparated by a tab.  Raw strings are particularly useful when constructing regular expressions for matching, as it eliminates the need to double\nescape special characters.\nA simple example is a regex to match a valid Rego variable. With a regular string, the regex is \"[a-zA-Z_]\\\\w*\", but with raw strings, it becomes `[a-zA-Z_]\\w*` .\nComposite Values\nComposite values define collections. In simple cases, composite values can be treated as constants like Scalar Values:\ncube = {\"width\": 3, \"height\": 4, \"depth\": 5}\n\nThe result:\n> cube.width\n3\n\nComposite values can also be defined in terms of Variables or References. For example:\n> a = 42; b = false; c = null; d = {\"a\": a, \"x\": [b, c]}\n+----+-------+------+---------------------------+\n| A  |   B   |  C   |             D             |\n+----+-------+------+---------------------------+\n| 42 | false | null | {\"a\":42,\"x\":[false,null]} |\n+----+-------+------+---------------------------+\n\nBy defining composite values in terms of variables and references, rules can define abstractions over raw data and other rules.\nSets\nIn addition to arrays and objects, Rego supports set values. Sets are unordered\ncollections of unique values. Just like other composite values, sets can be\ndefined in terms of scalars, variables, references, and other composite values.\nFor example:\n> s = {cube.width, cube.height, cube.depth}; count(s, n)\n+---+---------+\n| n |    s    |\n+---+---------+\n| 3 | [5,4,3] |\n+---+---------+\n\n\nSet documents are collections of values without keys. OPA represents set\ndocuments as arrays when serializing to JSON or other formats that do not\nsupport a set data type. The important distinction between sets and arrays or\nobjects is that sets are unkeyed while arrays and objects are keyed, i.e., you\ncannot refer to the index of an element within a set.\n\nWhen comparing sets, the order of elements does not matter:\n> {1,2,3} = {3,1,2}\ntrue\nBecause sets are unordered, variables inside sets must be unified with a ground\nvalue outside of the set. If the variable is not unified with a ground value\noutside the set, OPA will complain:\n> {1,2,3} = {3,x,2}\n1 error occurred: 1:1: rego_unsafe_var_error: var x is unsafe\n\nBecause sets share curly-brace syntax with objects, and an empty object is\ndefined with {}, an empty set has to be constructed with a different syntax:\n> count(set(), n)\n+---+\n| n |\n+---+\n| 0 |\n+---+\n\nVariables\nVariables are another kind of term in Rego. They appear in both the head and body of rules.\nVariables appearing in the head of a rule can be thought of as input and output of the rule. Unlike many programming languages, where a variable is either an input or an output, in Rego a variable is simultaneously an input and an output. If a query supplies a value for a variable, that variable is an input, and if the query does not supply a value for a variable, that variable is an output.\nFor example:\nsites = [\n    {\"name\": \"prod\"},\n    {\"name\": \"smoke1\"},\n    {\"name\": \"dev\"}\n]\n\nq[name] { sites[i].name = name }\n\nIn this case, we evaluate q with a variable x (which is not bound to a value). As as result, the query returns all of the site names.\n> q[x]\n+----------+\n|    x     |\n+----------+\n| \"prod\"   |\n| \"smoke1\" |\n| \"dev\"    |\n+----------+\n\nOn the other hand, if we evaluate q with an input value for name we can determine whether name exists in the document defined by q:\n> q[\"smoke2\"]\nundefined\n> q[\"dev\"]\ntrue\n\nVariables appearing in the head of a rule must also appear in a non-negated equality expression within the same rule. This property ensures that if the rule is evaluated and all of the expressions evaluate to true for some set of variable bindings, the variable in the head of the rule will be defined.\nReferences\nReferences are used to access nested documents.\nThe examples in this section use the data defined in the Examples section.\nThe simplest reference contains no variables. For example, the following reference returns the hostname of the second server in the first site document from our example data:\n> sites[0].servers[1].hostname\n\"helium\"\n\nReferences are typically written using the “dot-access” style. The canonical form does away with . and closely resembles dictionary lookup in a language such as Python:\n> sites[0][\"servers\"][1][\"hostname\"]\n\"helium\"\n\nBoth forms are valid, however, the dot-access style is typically more readable. Note that there are four cases where brackets must be used:\n\nString keys containing characters other than [a-z], [A-Z], [0-9], or _ (underscore).\nNon-string keys such as numbers, booleans, and null.\nVariable keys which are described later.\nComposite keys which are described later.\n\nReferences are always prefixed with a variable that identifies the root\ndocument. In the example above this is p. The root document may be:\n\na local variable inside a rule.\na rule inside the same package.\na document stored in OPA.\na documented temporarily provided to OPA as part of a transaction.\n\nVariable Keys\nReferences can include variables as keys. References written this way are used to select a value from every element in a collection.\nThe following reference will select the hostnames of all the servers in our\nexample data:\n> sites[i].servers[j].hostname\n+---+---+------------------------------+\n| i | j | sites[i].servers[j].hostname |\n+---+---+------------------------------+\n| 0 | 0 | \"hydrogen\"                   |\n| 0 | 1 | \"helium\"                     |\n| 0 | 2 | \"lithium\"                    |\n| 1 | 0 | \"beryllium\"                  |\n| 1 | 1 | \"boron\"                      |\n| 1 | 2 | \"carbon\"                     |\n| 2 | 0 | \"nitrogen\"                   |\n| 2 | 1 | \"oxygen\"                     |\n+---+---+------------------------------+\n\nConceptually, this is the same as the following imperative (Python) code:\ndef hostnames(sites):\n    result = []\n    for site in sites:\n        for server in site.servers:\n            result.append(server.hostname)\n    return result\n\nIn the reference above, we effectively used variables named i and j to iterate the collections. If the variables are unused outside the reference, we prefer to replace them with an underscore (_) character. The reference above can be rewritten as:\n> sites[_].servers[_].hostname\n+------------------------------+\n| sites[_].servers[_].hostname |\n+------------------------------+\n| \"hydrogen\"                   |\n| \"helium\"                     |\n| \"lithium\"                    |\n| \"beryllium\"                  |\n| \"boron\"                      |\n| \"carbon\"                     |\n| \"nitrogen\"                   |\n| \"oxygen\"                     |\n+------------------------------+\n\nThe underscore is special because it cannot be referred to by other parts of the rule, e.g., the other side of the expression, another expression, etc. The underscore can be thought of as a special iterator. Each time an underscore is specified, a new iterator is instantiated.\n\nUnder the hood, OPA translates the _ character to a unique variable name that does not conflict with variables and rules that are in scope.\n\nComposite Keys\nReferences can include Composite Values as keys if the key is being used to refer into a set. Composite keys may not be used in refs\nfor base data documents, they are only valid for references into virtual documents.\nThis is useful for checking for the presence of composite values within a set, or extracting all values within a set matching some pattern.\nFor example:\n> s = {[1, 2], [1, 4], [2, 6]}\n> s[[1, 2]]\n[\n  1,\n  2\n]\n> s[[1, x]]\n+---+\n| x |\n+---+\n| 2 |\n| 4 |\n+---+\n\nMultiple Expressions\nRules are often written in terms of multiple expressions that contain references to documents. In the following example, the rule defines a set of arrays where each array contains an application name and a hostname of a server where the application is deployed.\napps_and_hostnames[[name, hostname]] {\n    apps[i].name = name\n    apps[i].servers[_] = server\n    sites[j].servers[k].name = server\n    sites[j].servers[k].hostname = hostname\n}\n\nThe result:\n> apps_and_hostnames[x]\n+----------------------+\n|          x           |\n+----------------------+\n| [\"web\",\"hydrogen\"]   |\n| [\"web\",\"helium\"]     |\n| [\"web\",\"beryllium\"]  |\n| [\"web\",\"boron\"]      |\n| [\"web\",\"nitrogen\"]   |\n| [\"mysql\",\"lithium\"]  |\n| [\"mysql\",\"carbon\"]   |\n| [\"mongodb\",\"oxygen\"] |\n+----------------------+\n\nDon’t worry about understanding everything in this example right now. There are just two important points:\n\nSeveral variables appear more than once in the body. When a variable is used in multiple locations, OPA will only produce documents for the rule with the variable bound to the same value in all expressions.\nThe rule is joining the apps and sites documents implicitly. In Rego (and other languages based on Datalog), joins are implicit.\n\nSelf-Joins\nUsing a different key on the same array or object provides the equivalent of self-join in SQL. For example, the following rule defines a document containing apps deployed on the same site as \"mysql\":\nsame_site[apps[k].name] {\n    apps[i].name = \"mysql\"\n    apps[i].servers[_] = server\n    sites[j].servers[_].name = server\n    sites[j].servers[_].name = other_server\n    server != other_server\n    apps[k].servers[_] = other_server\n}\n\nThe result:\n> same_site[x]\n+-------+\n|   x   |\n+-------+\n| \"web\" |\n| \"web\" |\n| \"web\" |\n| \"web\" |\n+-------+\n\nComprehensions\nComprehensions provide a concise way of building Composite Values from sub-queries.\nLike Rules, comprehensions consist of a head and a body. The body of a comprehension can be understood in exactly the same way as the body of a rule, that is, one or more expressions that must all be true in order for the overall body to be true. When the body evaluates to true, the head of the comprehension is evaluated to produce an element in the result.\nThe body of a comprehension is able to refer to variables defined in the outer body. For example:\n> region = \"west\"; names = [name | sites[i].region = region; sites[i].name = name]\n+-----------------+--------+\n|      names      | region |\n+-----------------+--------+\n| [\"smoke\",\"dev\"] | \"west\" |\n+-----------------+--------+\n\nIn the above query, the second expression contains an Array Comprehension that refers to the region variable. The region variable will be bound in the outer body.\n\nWhen a comprehension refers to a variable in an outer body, OPA will reorder expressions in the outer body so that variables referred to in the comprehension are bound by the time the comprehension is evaluated.\n\nComprehensions are similar to the same constructs found in other languages like Python. For example, we could write the above comprehension in Python as follows:\n# Python equivalent of Rego comprehension shown above.\nnames = [site.name for site in sites if site.region == \"west\"]\n\nComprehensions are often used to group elements by some key. A common use case for comprehensions is to assist in computing aggregate values (e.g., the number of containers running on a host).\nArray Comprehensions\nArray Comprehensions build array values out of sub-queries. Array Comprehensions have the form:\n[  |  ]\n\nFor example, the following rule defines an object where the keys are application names and the values are hostnames of servers where the application is deployed. The hostnames of servers are represented as an array.\napp_to_hostnames[app_name] = hostnames {\n    apps[_] = app\n    app_name = app.name\n    hostnames = [hostname | name = app.servers[_]\n                            sites[_].servers[_] = s\n                            s.name = name\n                            hostname = s.hostname]\n}\n\nThe result:\n> app_to_hostnames[app] = hostnames\n+-----------+------------------------------------------------------+\n|    app    |                      hostnames                       |\n+-----------+------------------------------------------------------+\n| \"web\"     | [\"hydrogen\",\"helium\",\"beryllium\",\"boron\",\"nitrogen\"] |\n| \"mysql\"   | [\"lithium\",\"carbon\"]                                 |\n| \"mongodb\" | [\"oxygen\"]                                           |\n+-----------+------------------------------------------------------+\n\nObject Comprehensions\nObject Comprehensions build object values out of sub-queries. Object Comprehensions have the form:\n{ :  |  }\n\nWe can use Object Comprehensions to write the rule from above as a comprehension instead:\napp_to_hostnames = {app.name: hostnames |\n    apps[_] = app\n    hostnames = [hostname |\n                    name = app.servers[_]\n                    sites[_].servers[_] = s\n                    s.name = name\n                    hostname = s.hostname]\n}\n\nThe result is the same:\n> app_to_hostnames[app]\n+-----------+------------------------------------------------------+\n|    app    |                app_to_hostnames[app]                 |\n+-----------+------------------------------------------------------+\n| \"web\"     | [\"hydrogen\",\"helium\",\"beryllium\",\"boron\",\"nitrogen\"] |\n| \"mysql\"   | [\"lithium\",\"carbon\"]                                 |\n| \"mongodb\" | [\"oxygen\"]                                           |\n+-----------+------------------------------------------------------+\n\nObject comprehensions are not allowed to have conflicting entries, similar to rules:\n> {\"foo\": y | y = z[_]; z = [1, 2, 3]}\n{\"foo\": y | y = z[_]; z = [1, 2, 3]}: eval_conflict_error: object comprehension produces conflicting outputs\n\nSet Comprehensions\nSet Comprehensions build set values out of sub-queries. Set Comprehensions have the form:\n{  |  }\n\nFor example, to construct a set from an array:\n> a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 5]\n> b = {x | x = a[_]}\n> b\n[\n  1,\n  2,\n  3,\n  4,\n  5\n]\n\nRules\nRules define the content of Virtual Documents in\nOPA. When OPA evaluates a rule, we say OPA generates the content of the\ndocument that is defined by the rule.\nThe sample code in this section make use of the data defined in  Examples.\nGenerating Sets\nThe following rule defines a set containing the hostnames of all servers:\nhostnames[name] { sites[_].servers[_].hostname = name }\n\nWhen we query for the content of hostnames we see the same data as we would if we queried using the sites[_].servers[_].hostname reference directly:\n> hostnames[name]\n+-------------+\n|    name     |\n+-------------+\n| \"hydrogen\"  |\n| \"helium\"    |\n| \"lithium\"   |\n| \"beryllium\" |\n| \"boron\"     |\n| \"carbon\"    |\n| \"nitrogen\"  |\n| \"oxygen\"    |\n+-------------+\n\nThis example introduces a few important aspects of Rego.\nFirst, the rule defines a set document where the contents are defined by the variable name. We know this rule defines a set document because the head only includes a key. All rules have the following form (where key, value, and body are all optional):\n ? ? ?\nFor a more formal definition of the rule syntax, see the Language Reference document.\nSecond, the sites[_].servers[_].hostname fragment selects the hostname attribute from all of the objects in the servers collection. From reading the fragment in isolation we cannot tell whether the fragment refers to arrays or objects. We only know that it refers to a collections of values.\nThird, the sites[_].servers[_].hostname = name expression binds the value of the hostname attribute to the variable name, which is also declared in the head of the rule.\nGenerating Objects\nRules that define objects are very similar to rules that define sets.\napps_by_hostname[hostname] = app {\n    sites[_].servers[_] = server\n    server.hostname = hostname\n    apps[i].servers[_] = server.name\n    apps[i].name = app\n}\n\nThe rule above defines an object that maps hostnames to app names. The main difference between this rule and one which defines a set is the rule head: in addition to declaring a key, the rule head also declares a value for the document.\nThe result:\n> apps_by_hostname[\"helium\"] = app\n+-------+\n|  app  |\n+-------+\n| \"web\" |\n+-------+\nIncremental Definitions\nA rule may be defined multiple times with the same name. When a rule is defined\nthis way, we refer to the rule definition as incremental because each\ndefinition is additive. The document produced by incrementally defined rules is\nthe union of the documents produced by each individual rule.\nFor example, we can write a rule that abstracts over our servers and\ncontainers data as instances:\ninstances[instance] {\n    sites[_].servers[_] = server\n    instance = {\"address\": server.hostname, \"name\": server.name}\n}\n\ninstances[instance] {\n    containers[_] = container\n    instance = {\"address\": container.ipaddress, \"name\": container.name}\n}\n\nIf the head of the rule is same, we can chain multiple rule bodies together to\nobtain the same result:\ninstances[instance] {\n    sites[_].servers[_] = server\n    instance = {\"address\": server.hostname, \"name\": server.name}\n} {\n    containers[_] = container\n    instance = {\"address\": container.ipaddress, \"name\": container.name}\n}\n\nAn incrementally defined rule can be intuitively understood as  OR  OR ... OR .\nThe result:\n> instances[x]\n+-----------------------------------------------+\n|                       x                       |\n+-----------------------------------------------+\n| {\"address\":\"hydrogen\",\"name\":\"web-0\"}         |\n| {\"address\":\"helium\",\"name\":\"web-1\"}           |\n| {\"address\":\"lithium\",\"name\":\"db-0\"}           |\n| {\"address\":\"beryllium\",\"name\":\"web-1000\"}     |\n| {\"address\":\"boron\",\"name\":\"web-1001\"}         |\n| {\"address\":\"carbon\",\"name\":\"db-1000\"}         |\n| {\"address\":\"nitrogen\",\"name\":\"web-dev\"}       |\n| {\"address\":\"oxygen\",\"name\":\"db-dev\"}          |\n| {\"address\":\"10.0.0.1\",\"name\":\"big_stallman\"}  |\n| {\"address\":\"10.0.0.2\",\"name\":\"cranky_euclid\"} |\n+-----------------------------------------------+\n\nComplete Definitions\nIn addition to rules that partially define sets and objects, Rego also\nsupports so-called complete definitions of any type of document. Rules provide\na complete definition by omitting the key in the head. Complete definitions are\ncommonly used for constants:\npi = 3.14159\n\n\nRego allows authors to omit the body of rules. If the body is omitted, it\ndefaults to true.\n\nDocuments produced by rules with complete definitions can only have one value at\na time. If evaluation produces multiple values for the same document, an error\nwill be returned.\nFor example:\n# Define user \"bob\" for test input.\nuser = \"bob\"\n\n# Define two sets of users: power users and restricted users. Accidentally\n# include \"bob\" in both.\npower_users = {\"alice\", \"bob\", \"fred\"}\nrestricted_users = {\"bob\", \"kim\"}\n\n# Power users get 32GB memory.\nmax_memory = 32 { power_users[user] }\n\n# Restricted users get 4GB memory.\nmax_memory = 4 { restricted_users[user] }\n\nError:\n> max_memory\nmax_memory: eval_conflict_error: completely defined rules must produce exactly one value\nOPA returns an error in this case because the rule definitions are in conflict. The value produced by max_memory cannot be 32 and 4 at the same time.\nThe documents produced by rules with complete definitions may still be undefined:\n> unset user\n> user = \"johnson\"  # user is not in either of the sets defined earlier.\n> max_memory\nundefined\n\nIn some cases, having an undefined result for a document is not desirable. In those cases, policies can use the Default Keyword to provide a fallback value.\nFunctions\nRego supports user-defined functions that can be called with the same semantics as Built-in Functions. They have access to both the the data Document and the input Document.\nFor example, the following function will return the result of trimming the spaces from a string and then splitting it by periods.\n> trim_and_split(s) = x {\n|     trim(s, \" \", t)\n|     split(t, \".\", x)\n| }\n|\n> trim_and_split(\"   foo.bar \", out)\n+---------------+\n|      out      |\n+---------------+\n| [\"foo\",\"bar\"] |\n+---------------+\n\nFunctions may have an arbitrary number of inputs, but exactly one output. Function arguments may be any kind of term. For example, suppose we have the following function:\nfoo([x, {\"bar\": y}]) = z {\n    z = {x: y}\n}\nThe following calls would produce the logical mappings given:\n\n\n\nCall\nx\ny\n\n\n\n\nfoo(a, z)\na[0]\na[1].bar\n\n\nfoo([\"5\", {\"bar\": \"hello\"}], z)\n\"5\"\n\"hello\"\n\n\nfoo([\"5\", {\"bar\": [1, 2, 3, [\"foo\", \"bar\"]]}], z)\n\"5\"\n[1, 2, 3, [\"foo\", \"bar\"]]\n\n\n\nIf you need multiple outputs, write your functions so that the output is an array, object or set containing your results. If the output term is omitted, it is equivalent to having the output term be the literal true. That is, the function declarations below are equivalent:\nf(x) {\n    x = \"foo\"\n}\n\nf(x) = true {\n    x = \"foo\"\n}\nThe outputs of user functions have some additional limitations, namely that they must resolve to a single value. If you write a function that has multiple possible bindings for an output variable, you will get a conflict error:\n> p(x) = y {\n|     x[_] = y\n| }\n|\n> p([1, 2, 3], out)\np([1, 2, 3], out): eval_conflict_error: completely defined rules must produce exactly one value\n\nIt is possible in Rego to define a function more than once, to achieve a conditional selection of which function to execute:\nFunctions can be defined incrementally.\n> p(1, x) = y {\n|     y = x\n| }\n|\n> p(2, x) = y {\n|     y = x*4\n| }\n|\n> p(1, 2, y)\n+---+\n| y |\n+---+\n| 2 |\n+---+\n> p(2, 2, y)\n+---+\n| y |\n+---+\n| 8 |\n+---+\n\nA given function call will execute all functions that match the signature given. If a call matches multiple functions, they must produce the same output, or else a conflict error will occur:\n> p(1, x) = y {\n|     y = x\n| }\n|\n> p(x, 2) = y {\n|     y = x*4\n| }\n|\n> p(1, 2, y)\np(1, 2, y): eval_conflict_error: completely defined rules must produce exactly one value\n\nOn the other hand, if a call matches no functions, then the result is undefined, and the query containing it will become unsatisfied.\n> p(x, 2) = y {\n|     y = x*4\n| }\n|\n> p(5, 2, y)\n+----+\n| y  |\n+----+\n| 20 |\n+----+\n> p(5, 3, y)\nfalse\nNegation\nTo generate the content of a Virtual Document, OPA attempts to bind variables in the body of the rule such that all expressions in the rule evaluate to True.\nThis generates the correct result when the expressions represent assertions about what states should exist in the data stored in OPA. In some cases, you want to express that certain states should not exist in the data stored in OPA. In these cases, negation must be used.\nFor safety, a variable appearing in a negated expression must also appear in another non-negated equality expression in the rule.\n\nOPA will reorder expressions to ensure that negated expressions are evaluated after other non-negated expressions with the same variables. OPA will reject rules containing negated expressions that do not meet the safety criteria described above.\n\nThe simplest use of negation involves only scalar values or variables and is equivalent to complementing the operator:\nt {\n    greeting = \"hello\"\n    not greeting = \"goodbye\"\n}\n\nThe result:\n> t\ntrue\n\nNegation is required to check whether some value does not exist in a collection. That is, complementing the operator in an expression such as p[_] = \"foo\" yields p[_] != \"foo\". However, this is not equivalent to not p[\"foo\"].\nFor example, we can write a rule that defines a document containing names of apps not deployed on the \"prod\" site:\nprod_servers[name] {\n    sites[_] = site\n    site.name = \"prod\"\n    site.servers[_].name = name\n}\n\napps_in_prod[name] {\n    apps[_] = app\n    app.servers[_] = server\n    app.name = name\n    prod_servers[server]\n}\n\napps_not_in_prod[name] {\n    apps[_].name = name\n    not apps_in_prod[name]\n}\n\nThe result:\n> apps_not_in_prod[name]\n+-----------+\n|   name    |\n+-----------+\n| \"mongodb\" |\n+-----------+\n\nModules\nIn Rego, policies are defined inside modules. Modules consist of:\n\nExactly one Package declaration.\nZero or more Import statements.\nZero or more Rule definitions.\n\nModules are typically represented in Unicode text and encoded in UTF-8.\nComments\nComments begin with the # character and continue until the end of the line.\nPackages\nPackages group the rules defined in one or more modules into a particular namespace. Because rules are namespaced they can be safely shared across projects.\nModules contributing to the same package do not have to be located in the same directory.\nThe rules defined in a module are automatically exported. That is, they can be queried under OPA’s Data API provided the appropriate package is given. For example, given the following module:\npackage opa.examples\n\npi = 3.14159\n\nThe pi document can be queried via the Data API:\nGET https://example.com/v1/data/opa/examples/pi HTTP/1.1\n\nImports\nImport statements declare dependencies that modules have on documents defined outside the package. By importing a document, the identifiers exported by that document can be referenced within the current module.\nAll modules contain implicit statements which import the data and input documents.\nModules use the same syntax to declare dependencies on Base Documents and Virtual Documents.\npackage opa.examples\n\nimport data.servers\n\nhttp_servers[server] {\n    server = servers[_]\n    server.protocols[_] = \"http\"\n}\n\nSimilarly, modules can declare dependencies on query arguments by specifying an import path that starts with input.\npackage opa.examples\n\nimport input.user\nimport input.method\n\n# allow alice to perform any operation.\nallow { user = \"alice\" }\n\n# allow bob to perform read-only operations.\nallow {\n    user = \"bob\"\n    method = \"GET\"\n}\n\n# allows users assigned a \"dev\" role to perform read-only operations.\nallow {\n    method = \"GET\"\n    data.roles[\"dev\"][_] = input.user\n}\n\nImports can include an optional as keyword to handle namespacing issues:\npackage opa.examples\n\nimport data.servers as my_servers\n\nhttp_servers[server] {\n    server = my_servers[_]\n    server.protocols[_] = \"http\"\n}\n\nWith Keyword\nThe with keyword allows queries to programmatically specify values nested\nunder the input Document and the data Document.\nFor example, given the simple authorization policy in the Imports\nsection, we can write a query that checks whether a particular request would be\nallowed:\n> import data.opa.examples.allow\n> allow with input as {\"user\": \"alice\", \"method\": \"POST\"}\ntrue\n> allow with input as {\"user\": \"bob\", \"method\": \"GET\"}\ntrue\n> not allow with input as {\"user\": \"bob\", \"method\": \"DELETE\"}\ntrue\n> allow with input as {\"user\": \"charlie\", \"method\": \"GET\"} with data.roles as {\"dev\": [\"charlie\"]}\ntrue\n> not allow with input as {\"user\": \"charlie\", \"method\": \"GET\"} with data.roles as {\"dev\": [\"bob\"]}\ntrue\n\nThe with keyword acts as a modifier on expressions. A single expression is\nallowed to have zero or more with modifiers. The with keyword has the\nfollowing syntax:\n with  as  [with  as  [...]]\nThe s must be references to values in the input document (or the input\ndocument itself) or data document.\nDefault Keyword\nThe default keyword allows policies to define a default value for documents\nproduced by rules with Complete Definitions. The\ndefault value is used when all of the rules sharing the same name are undefined.\nFor example:\ndefault allow = false\n\nallow {\n    input.user = \"bob\"\n    input.method = \"GET\"\n}\n\nallow {\n    input.user = \"alice\"\n}\n\nWhen the allow document is queried, the return value will be either true or false.\n> allow with input.user as \"bob\" with input.method as \"POST\"\nfalse\n\nWithout the default definition, the allow document would simply be undefined for the same input.\nWhen the default keyword is used, the rule syntax is restricted to:\ndefault  = \nThe term may be any scalar, composite, or comprehension value but it may not be\na variable or reference. If the value is a composite then it may not contain\nvariables or references.\nElse Keyword\nThe else  keyword is a basic control flow construct that gives you control\nover rule evaluation order.\nRules grouped together with the else keyword are evaluated until a match is\nfound. Once a match is found, rule evaluation does not proceed to rules further\nin the chain.\nThe else keyword is useful if you are porting policies into Rego from an\norder-sensitive system like IPTables.\nauthorize = \"allow\" {\n    input.user = \"superuser\"           # allow 'superuser' to perform any operation.\n} else = \"deny\" {\n    input.path[0] = \"admin\"            # disallow 'admin' operations...\n    input.source_network = \"external\"  # from external networks.\n} # ... more rules\n\nIn the example below, evaluation stops immediately after the first rule even\nthough the input matches the second rule as well.\n> input\n{\n  \"path\": [\n    \"admin\",\n    \"exec_shell\"\n  ],\n  \"source_network\": \"external\",\n  \"user\": \"superuser\"\n}\n> authorize\n\"allow\"\n\nIn the next example, the input matches the second rule (but not the first) so\nevaluation continues to the second rule before stopping.\n> input\n{\n  \"path\": [\n    \"admin\",\n    \"exec_shell\"\n  ],\n  \"source_network\": \"external\",\n  \"user\": \"alice\"\n}\n> authorize\n\"deny\"\n\nThe else keyword may be used repeatedly on the same rule and there is no\nlimit imposed on the number of else clauses on a rule.\nOperators\nEquality\nThe equality operator (=) is used to define expressions that assert that\ntwo values are the same. If the expression is defined in terms of one or more\nvariables then the expression will evaluate to true if one of the variables\nis unbound. If the neither operand is an unbound variable, the expression is\nevaluated by comparing the values referenced by the operands.\nOPA attempts to bind variables to values when it encounters unbound\nvariables in equality expressions. Binding a variable affects subsequent\nevaluation of expressions such that the variable will be treated as a\nconstant (with the bound value) instead of a variable.\nAssignment\nThe assignment operator (:=) is used to define local variables. Unlike\nequality (=), assigned variables are locally scoped and shadow global\nsymbols.\npackage example\n\nx = 100\n\np {\n    x := 1     # declare local variable 'x'\n    x != 100   # true because 'x' refers to local variable\n}\n\nAssigned variables are not allowed to appear before the assignment in the\nquery. For example, the following policy will not compile:\npackage example\n\np {\n    x != 100\n    x := 1     # error because x appears earlier in the query.\n}\n\nq {\n    x := 1\n    x := 2     # error because x is assigned twice.\n}\n\nComparison\nThe following comparison operators are supported:\na  ==  b  #  `a` is equal to `b`.\na  !=  b  #  `a` is not equal to `b`.\na     b  #  `a` is greater than `b`.\na  >=  b  #  `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.\n\nUnlike the equality operator, these operators do not bind variables contained\nin the expression. As a result, if either operand is a variable, the variable\nmust appear in another expression in the same rule that would cause the\nvariable to be bound, i.e., an equality expression or the target position of\na built-in function.\nBuilt-in Functions\nIn some cases, rules must perform simple arithmetic, aggregation, and so on.\nRego provides a number of built-in functions (or “built-ins”) for performing\nthese tasks.\nBuilt-ins can be easily recognized by their syntax. All built-ins have the\nfollowing form:\n(, , ..., )\nBuilt-ins usually take one or more input values and produce at least one output\nvalue. Unless stated otherwise, all built-ins accept values or variables as\noutput arguments.\nIf a built-in function is invoked with a variable as input, the variable must\nbe safe, i.e., it must be assigned elsewhere in the query.\nBuilt-ins can include \".\" characters in the name. This allows them to be\nnamespaced. If you are adding custom built-ins to OPA, consider namespacing\nthem to avoid naming conflicts, e.g., org.example.special_func.\nSee the Language Reference document for\ndetails on each built-in function.\nExample Data\nThe rules below define the content of documents describing a simplistic deployment environment.

By writing\ntests for your policies you can speed up the development process of new rules\nand reduce the amount of time it takes to modify rules as requirements evolve.\nGetting Started\nLet's use an example to get started. The file below implements a simple\npolicy that allows new users to be created and users to access their own\nprofile.\nexample.rego:\npackage authz\n\nallow {\n    input.path = [\"users\"]\n    input.method = \"POST\"\n}\n\nallow {\n    input.path = [\"users\", profile_id]\n    input.method = \"GET\"\n    profile_id = input.user_id\n}\n\nTo test this policy, we will create a separate Rego file that contains test cases.\nexample_test.rego:\npackage authz\n\ntest_post_allowed {\n    allow with input as {\"path\": [\"users\"], \"method\": \"POST\"}\n}\n\ntest_get_anonymous_denied {\n    not allow with input as {\"path\": [\"users\"], \"method\": \"GET\"}\n}\n\ntest_get_user_allowed {\n    allow with input as {\"path\": [\"users\", \"bob\"], \"method\": \"GET\", \"user_id\": \"bob\"}\n}\n\ntest_get_another_user_denied {\n    not allow with input as {\"path\": [\"users\", \"bob\"], \"method\": \"GET\", \"user_id\": \"alice\"}\n}\n\nBoth of these files are saved in the same directory.\n$ ls\nexample.rego      example_test.rego\n\nTo exercise the policy, run the opa test command in the directory containing the files.\n$ opa test . -v\ndata.authz.test_post_allowed: PASS (1.417µs)\ndata.authz.test_get_anonymous_denied: PASS (426ns)\ndata.authz.test_get_user_allowed: PASS (367ns)\ndata.authz.test_get_another_user_denied: PASS (320ns)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPASS: 4/4\n\nThe opa test output indicates that all of the tests passed.\nTry exercising the tests a bit more by removing the first rule in example.rego.\n$ opa test . -v\ndata.authz.test_post_allowed: FAIL (607ns)\ndata.authz.test_get_anonymous_denied: PASS (288ns)\ndata.authz.test_get_user_allowed: PASS (346ns)\ndata.authz.test_get_another_user_denied: PASS (365ns)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPASS: 3/4\nFAIL: 1/4\n\nTest Format\nTests are expressed as standard Rego rules with a convention that the rule\nname is prefixed with test_.\npackage mypackage\n\ntest_some_descriptive_name {\n    # test logic\n}\n\nTest Discovery\nThe opa test subcommand runs all of the tests (i.e., rules prefixed with\ntest_) found in Rego files passed on the command line. If directories are\npassed as command line arguments, opa test will load their file contents\nrecursively.\nTest Results\nIf the test rule is undefined or generates a non-true value the test result\nis reported as FAIL. If the test encounters a runtime error (e.g., a divide\nby zero condition) the test result is marked as an ERROR. Otherwise, the\ntest result is marked as PASS.\npass_fail_error_test.rego:\npackage example\n\n# This test will pass.\ntest_ok {\n    true\n}\n\n# This test will fail.\ntest_failure {\n    1 = 2\n}\n\n# This test will error.\ntest_error {\n    1 / 0\n}\n\nBy default, opa test reports the number of tests executed and displays all\nof the tests that failed or errored.\n$ opa test pass_fail_error_test.rego\ndata.example.test_failure: FAIL (253ns)\ndata.example.test_error: ERROR (289ns)\n  pass_fail_error_test.rego:15: eval_internal_error: div: divide by zero\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPASS: 1/3\nFAIL: 1/3\nERROR: 1/3\n\nBy default, OPA prints the test results in a human-readable format. If you\nneed to consume the test results programmatically, use the JSON output format.\n$ opa test --format=json pass_fail_error_test.rego\n\n[\n  {\n    \"location\": {\n      \"file\": \"pass_fail_error_test.rego\",\n      \"row\": 4,\n      \"col\": 1\n    },\n    \"package\": \"data.example\",\n    \"name\": \"test_ok\",\n    \"duration\": 618515\n  },\n  {\n    \"location\": {\n      \"file\": \"pass_fail_error_test.rego\",\n      \"row\": 9,\n      \"col\": 1\n    },\n    \"package\": \"data.example\",\n    \"name\": \"test_failure\",\n    \"fail\": true,\n    \"duration\": 322177\n  },\n  {\n    \"location\": {\n      \"file\": \"pass_fail_error_test.rego\",\n      \"row\": 14,\n      \"col\": 1\n    },\n    \"package\": \"data.example\",\n    \"name\": \"test_error\",\n    \"error\": {\n      \"code\": \"eval_internal_error\",\n      \"message\": \"div: divide by zero\",\n      \"location\": {\n        \"file\": \"pass_fail_error_test.rego\",\n        \"row\": 15,\n        \"col\": 5\n      }\n    },\n    \"duration\": 345148\n  }\n]\n\nData Mocking\nOPA's with keyword can be used to replace the data document. Both base and virtual documents can be replaced. Below is a simple policy that depends on the data document.\nauthz.rego:\npackage authz\n\nallow {\n    x := data.policies[_]\n    x.name = \"test_policy\"\n    matches_role(input.role)\n}\n\nmatches_role(my_role) {\n    data.roles[my_role][_] = input.user\n}\n\nBelow is the Rego file to test the above policy.\nauthz_test.rego:\npackage authz\n\npolicies = [{\"name\": \"test_policy\"}]\nroles = {\"admin\": [\"alice\"]}\n\ntest_allow_with_data {\n    allow with input as {\"user\": \"alice\", \"role\": \"admin\"}  with data.policies as policies  with data.roles as roles\n}\n\nTo exercise the policy, run the opa test command.\n$ opa test -v authz.rego authz_test.rego\ndata.authz.test_allow_with_data: PASS (697ns)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPASS: 1/1\n\nBelow is an example to replace a rule without arguments.\nauthz.rego:\npackage authz\n\nallow1 {\n    allow2\n}\n\nallow2 {\n    2 = 1\n}\n\nauthz_test.rego:\npackage authz\n\ntest_replace_rule {\n    allow1 with allow2 as true\n}\n\n$  opa test -v authz.rego authz_test.rego\ndata.authz.test_replace_rule: PASS (328ns)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPASS: 1/1\n\nFunctions with arguments cannot be replaced by the with keyword. For example, in the below policy the function cannot_replace cannot be replaced.\nauthz.rego:\npackage authz\n\ninvalid_replace {\n    cannot_replace(input.label)\n}\n\ncannot_replace(label) {\n    label = \"test_label\"\n}\n\nauthz_test.rego:\npackage authz\n\ntest_invalid_replace {\n    invalid_replace with input as {\"label\": \"test_label\"} with cannot_replace as true\n}\n\n$ opa test -v authz.rego authz_test.rego\n1 error occurred: authz_test.rego:4: rego_compile_error: with keyword cannot replace rules with arguments\n\nCoverage\nIn addition to reporting pass, fail, and error results for tests, opa test\ncan also report coverage for the policies under test.\nThe coverage report includes all of the lines evaluated and not evaluated in\nthe Rego files provided on the command line. When a line is not covered it\nindicates one of two things:\n\nIf the line refers to the head of a rule, the body of the rule was never true.\nIf the line refers to an expression in a rule, the expression was never evaluated.\n\nIf we run the coverage report on the original example.rego file without\ntest_get_user_allowed from example_test.rego the report will indicate\nthat line 8 is not covered.\nopa test --coverage --format=json example.rego example_test.rego\n\n{\n  \"files\": {\n    \"example.rego\": {\n      \"covered\": [\n        {\n          \"start\": {\n            \"row\": 3\n          },\n          \"end\": {\n            \"row\": 5\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \"start\": {\n            \"row\": 9\n          },\n          \"end\": {\n            \"row\": 11\n          }\n        }\n      ],\n      \"not_covered\": [\n        {\n          \"start\": {\n            \"row\": 8\n          },\n          \"end\": {\n            \"row\": 8\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    \"example_test.rego\": {\n      \"covered\": [\n        {\n          \"start\": {\n            \"row\": 3\n          },\n          \"end\": {\n            \"row\": 4\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \"start\": {\n            \"row\": 7\n          },\n          \"end\": {\n            \"row\": 8\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \"start\": {\n            \"row\": 11\n          },\n          \"end\": {\n            \"row\": 12\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nProfiling\nIn addition to testing and coverage reporting, you can also profile your\npolicies using opa eval. The profiler is useful if you need to understand\nwhy policy evaluation is slow.\nThe opa eval command provides the following profiler options:\n\n\n\nOption\nDetail\nDefault\n\n\n\n\n--profile\nEnables expression profiling and outputs profiler results.\noff\n\n\n--profile-sort\nCriteria to sort the expression profiling results.

Caution: Policies that depend on the output of opa.runtime may return different answers depending on how OPA was started. If possible, prefer using an explicit input or data value instead of opa.runtime. The output of opa.runtime will include a \"config\" key if OPA was started with a configuration file. The output of opa.runtime will include a \"env\" key containing the environment variables that the OPA process was started with.\n\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\n\nBuilt-in\nInputs\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ntrace(string)\n1\ntrace outputs the debug message string as a Note event in the query explanation.

However, in some cases, the result of Partial Evaluation is a conclusive, unconditional answer.\nFor example, if you extend to policy above to include a \"break glass\" condition, the decision may be to allow all requests regardless of clearance level.\npackage example\n\nallow {\n  input.subject.clearance_level >= data.reports[_].clearance_level\n}\n\nallow {\n  data.break_glass = true\n}\n\nIn this case, if data.break_glass is true then the query\ndata.example.allow == true will always be true. If the query is\nalways true, the \"queries\" value in the result will contain an empty\narray. The empty array indicates that your query can be satisfied\nwithout any further evaluation.\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  \"result\": {\n    \"queries\": [\n      [],\n      [\n        {\n          \"index\": 0,\n          \"terms\": [\n            {\n              \"type\": \"ref\",\n              \"value\": [\n                {\n                  \"type\": \"var\",\n                  \"value\": \"gte\"\n                }\n              ]\n            },\n            {\n              \"type\": \"number\",\n              \"value\": 4\n            },\n            {\n              \"type\": \"ref\",\n              \"value\": [\n                {\n                  \"type\": \"var\",\n                  \"value\": \"data\"\n                },\n                {\n                  \"type\": \"string\",\n                  \"value\": \"reports\"\n                },\n                {\n                  \"type\": \"var\",\n                  \"value\": \"$02\"\n                },\n                {\n                  \"type\": \"string\",\n                  \"value\": \"clearance_level\"\n                }\n              ]\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\nIt is also possible for queries to never be true. For example, the\noriginal policy could be extended to require that users be granted an\nexception:\npackage example\n\nallow {\n  input.subject.clearance_level >= data.reports[_].clearance_level\n  exceptions[input.subject.name]\n}\n\nexceptions[\"bob\"]\nexceptions[\"alice\"]\n\nIn this case, if we execute query on behalf of a user that does not\nhave an exception (e.g., \"eve\"), the OPA response will not contain a\nqueries field at all. This indicates there are NO conditions that\ncould make the query true.\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  \"result\": {}\n}\n\nThe following table summarizes the behavior for partial evaluation results.\n\n\n\nExample Query\nUnknowns\nResult\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ninput.x > 0\n[\"input\"]\n{\"result\": {\"queries\": [[input.x > 0]]}}\nThe query is partially evaluated and remaining conditions are returned.\n\n\ninput.x > 0\nNot specified.\n{\"result\": {\"queries\": [[input.x > 0]]}}\nIf the set of unknowns is not specified, it defaults to [\"input\"].\n\n\ninput.x > 0\n[]\n{\"result\": {}}\nThe query is false/undefined because there are no unknowns.\n\n\n1 > 0\nN/A\n{\"result\": {\"queries\": [[]]}}\nThe query is always true.\n\n\n1 \nN/A\n{\"result\": {}}\nThe query is always false.\n\n\n\n\nThe partially evaluated queries are represented as strings in the table above.

For example, if a client uses the HEAD method to access any path within \"/v1/data/{path:.*}\", a 405 will be returned.\nExplanations\nOPA supports query explanations that describe (in detail) the steps taken to\nproduce query results.\nExplanations can be requested for:\n\nData API GET queries\nQuery API queries\n\nExplanations are requested by setting the explain query parameter to one of\nthe following values:\n\nfull - returns a full query trace containing every step in the query evaluation process.\n\nBy default, explanations are represented in a machine-friendly format. Set the\npretty parameter to request a human-friendly format for debugging purposes.\nTrace Events\nWhen the explain query parameter is set to full , the response contains an array of Trace Event objects.\nTrace Event objects contain the following fields:\n\nop - identifies the kind of Trace Event. Values: \"Enter\", \"Exit\", \"Eval\", \"Fail\", \"Redo\".\nquery_id - uniquely identifies the query that the Trace Event was emitted for.\nparent_id - identifies the parent query.\ntype - indicates the type of the node field. Values: \"expr\", \"rule\", \"body\".\nnode - contains the AST element associated with the evaluation step.\nlocals - contains the term bindings from the query at the time when the Trace Event was emitted.\n\nQuery IDs\nQueries often reference rules or contain comprehensions. In both cases, query\nevaluation involves evaluation of one or more other queries, e.g., the body of\nthe rule or comprehension.\nTrace Events from different queries can be distinguished by the query_id\nfield.\nTrace Events from related queries can be identified by the parent_id field.\nFor example, if query A references a rule R, Trace Events emitted as part of\nevaluating rule R's body will have the parent_id field set to query A's\nquery_id.\nTypes of Events\nEach Trace Event represents a step in the query evaluation process. Trace Events\nare emitted at the following points:\n\nenter - before a body or rule is evaluated.\nexit - after a body or rule has evaluated successfully.\neval - before an expression is evaluated.\nfail - after an expression has evaluated to false.\nredo - before evaluation restarts from a body, rule, or expression.\n\nBy default, OPA searches for all sets of term bindings that make all expressions\nin the query evaluate to true. Because there may be multiple answers, the search\ncan restart when OPA determines the query is true or false. When the search\nrestarts, a Redo Trace Event is emitted.\nExample Trace Event\n{\n  \"op\": \"eval\",\n  \"query_id\": 20,\n  \"parent_id\": 0,\n  \"type\": \"expr\",\n  \"node\": {\n    \"index\": 1,\n    \"terms\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"var\",\n        \"value\": \"eq\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"var\",\n        \"value\": \"x\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"var\",\n        \"value\": \"y\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  \"locals\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": {\n        \"type\": \"var\",\n        \"value\": \"x\"\n      },\n      \"value\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"value\": \"hello\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nPerformance Metrics\nOPA can report detailed performance metrics at runtime. Performance metrics can\nbe requested on individual API calls and are returned inline with the API\nresponse. To enable performance metric collection on an API call, specify the\nmetrics=true query parameter when executing the API call. Performance metrics\nare currently supported for the following APIs:\n\nData API (GET and POST)\nPolicy API (all methods)\nQuery API (all methods)\n\nFor example:\nPOST /v1/data/example?metrics=true HTTP/1.1\n\nResponse:\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  \"metrics\": {\n    \"timer_rego_query_compile_ns\": 69994,\n    \"timer_rego_query_eval_ns\": 48425,\n    \"timer_rego_query_parse_ns\": 4096\n  },\n  \"result\": {\n    \"some_strings\": [\n      \"hello\",\n      \"world\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\nOPA currently supports the following query performance metrics:\n\ntimer_rego_query_parse_ns: time taken (in nanonseconds) to parse the query.\ntimer_rego_query_compile_ns: time taken (in nanonseconds) to compile the query.\ntimer_rego_query_eval_ns: time taken (in nanonseconds) to evaluate the query.\ntimer_rego_module_parse_ns: time taken (in nanoseconds) to parse the input policy module.\ntimer_rego_module_compile_ns: time taken (in nanoseconds) to compile the loaded policy modules.\ntimer_server_handler_ns: time take (in nanoseconds) to handle the API request.\n\nOPA also supports query instrumentation. To enable query instrumentation,\nspecify the instrument=true query parameter when executing the API call.\nQuery instrumentation can help diagnose performance problems, however, it can\nadd significant overhead to query evaluation. We recommend leaving query\ninstrumentation off unless you are debugging a performance problem.\nWatches\nOPA can set watches on queries and report whenever the result of evaluating the query has changed. When a watch is set on a query, the requesting connection will be maintained as the query results are streamed back in HTTP Chunked Encoding format. A notification reflecting a certain change to the query results will be delivered at most once. That is, if a watch is set on data.x, and then multiple writes are made to data.x, say 1, 2 and 3, only the notification reflecting data.x=3 is always seen eventually (assuming the watch is not ended, there are no connection problems, etc). The notifications reflecting data.x=1 and data.x=2 might be seen. However, the notifications sent are guaranteed to be in order (data.x=2 will always come after data.x=1, if it comes).\nThe notification stream will not be delimited by any value; the client is expected to be able to parse JSON values from the stream one by one, recognizing where one ends and the next begins.\nThe notification stream is a stream of JSON objects, each of which has the following structure:\n{\n    \"result\": ,\n    \"error\": ,\n    \"metrics\": ,\n    \"explanation\": ,\n}\nThe error field is optional; it is omitted when no errors occur. If it is present, it is an Error describing any errors encountered while evaluating the query the watch was set on. If the policies on the server are changed such that the query no longer compiles, the contents of the error's message field will start with the text \"watch invalidated:\" and will be followed with the reason for invalidation. The watch will be ended by the server and the stream closed.\nThe metrics field represents Performance Metrics for the evaluation of the query. It will only be present if metrics were requested in the API call that started the watch.\nThe explanation field represents an Explanation of how the query answer was found. It will only be present if explanations were requested in the API call that started the watch.\nIf there are no errors, the result field will be a JSON array of the results of evaluating the query. The format of a result is:\n{\n    \"expressions\": [\n        {\n            \"value\": true,\n            \"text\": \"a = data.x\",\n            \"location\":{\"row\":1,\"col\":1}\n        },\n        ...\n    ],\n    \"bindings\": {...}\n}\nThe expressions field is an array of the results of evaluating each of the expressions in the query. value is the expression's value, text is the actual expression, and location describes the location of the expression within the query. The values above are examples.\nThe bindings field is a JSON object mapping strings to JSON values that describe the variable bindings resulting from evaluating the query.\nIf the watch was set on a data reference instead of a query, the result field will simply be the value of the document requested, instead of an array of values.\n"},"deployments.html":{"url":"deployments.html","title":"Deployments","keywords":"","body":"Deployments\nThis document helps you get OPA up and running in different deployment\nenvironments. You should read this document if you are planning to deploy OPA.\nDocker\nDocker makes OPA easy to deploy in different types of environments.\nThis section explains how to use the official OPA Docker images. If this is your\nfirst time deploying OPA and you plan to use one of the Docker images, we\nrecommend you review this section to familiarize yourself with the basics.\nOPA releases are available as images on Docker Hub.\n\nopenpolicyagent/opa:0.10.4\n\nRunning with Docker\nIf you start OPA outside of Docker without any arguments, it prints a list of\navailable commands. By default, the official OPA Docker image executes the run\ncommand which starts an instance of OPA as an interactive shell. This is nice\nfor development, however, for deployments, we want to run OPA as a server.\nThe run command accepts a --server (or -s) flag that starts OPA as a\nserver. See --help for more information on other arguments. The most important\ncommand line arguments for OPA's server mode are:\n\n--addr to set the listening address (default: 0.0.0.0:8181).\n--log-level (or -l) to set the log level (default: \"info\").\n--log-format to set the log format (default: \"text\").\n\nBy default, OPA listens for normal HTTP connections on 0.0.0.0:8181. To make\nOPA listen for HTTPS connections, see Security.\nWe can run OPA as a server using Docker:\ndocker run -p 8181:8181 openpolicyagent/opa \\\n    run --server --log-level debug\n\nTest that OPA is available:\ncurl -i localhost:8181/\nLogging\nOPA logs to stderr and the level can be set with --log-level/-l. The default log level is info which causes OPA to log request/response headers.\ntime=\"20.7.13-12T03:03:23Z\" level=info msg=\"First line of log stream.\" addr=\":8181\"\ntime=\"20.7.13-12T03:03:30Z\" level=debug msg=\"Received request.\" client_addr=\"172.17.0.1:60952\" req_body= req_id=1 req_method=GET req_params=map[] req_path=\"/v1/data\"\ntime=\"20.7.13-12T03:03:30Z\" level=debug msg=\"Sent response.\" client_addr=\"172.17.0.1:60952\" req_id=1 req_method=GET req_path=\"/v1/data\" resp_bytes=13 resp_duration=0.402793 resp_status=200\nIf the log level is set to debug the request and response message bodies will be logged.

When running inside Docker, you can\nprovide files via volume mounts.\ndocker run -v $PWD:/example openpolicyagent/opa eval --data /example 'data.example.greeting'\n\n$PWD/example/data.json:\n{\n    \"hostOS\": \"$(uname)\"\n}\n\n\n$PWD/example/policy.rego:\npackage example\n\ngreeting = msg {\n    concat(\"\", [\"Hello \", data.example.hostOS, \"!\"], msg)\n}\n\n\n\nMore Information\nFor more information on OPA's command line, see --help:\ndocker run openpolicyagent/opa run --help\nTagging\nThe Docker Hub repository contains tags for every release of OPA. For more\ninformation on each release see the GitHub\nReleases page.\nThe \"latest\" tag refers to the most recent release. The latest tag is convenient\nif you want to quickly try out OPA however for production deployments, we\nrecommend using an explicit version tag.\nDevelopment builds are also available on Docker Hub. For each version the\n{version}-dev tag refers the most recent development build for that version.\nThe version information is contained in the OPA executable itself. You can check\nthe version with the following command:\ndocker run openpolicyagent/opa version\n\nKubernetes\nKicking the Tires\nThis section shows how to quickly deploy OPA on top of Kubernetes to try it out.\n\nThese steps assume Kubernetes is deployed with\nminikube. If you are using a different\nKubernetes provider, the steps should be similar. You may need to use a\ndifferent Service configuration at the end.\n\nFirst, create a ConfigMap containing a test policy. The test policy will define a blacklist that rejects:\n\nObjects missing a 'customer' label.\nPods referring to images outside the corporate registry.\n\nIn this case, the policy file does not contain sensitive information so it's\nfine to store as a ConfigMap. If the file contained sensitive information, then\nwe recommend you store it as a Secret.\nexample.rego\npackage example\n\ndefault deny = false\n\n# Reject objects without a customer label.\ndeny {\n    not input.metadata.labels.customer\n}\n\n# Reject pods referring to images outside the corporate registry.\ndeny {\n    input.kind = \"Pod\"\n    container = input.spec.containers[_]\n    not re_match(\"^registry.acmecorp.com/.+$\", container.image)\n}\n\nkubectl create configmap example-policy --from-file example.rego\n\nNext, create a Deployment to run OPA. The ConfigMap containing the policy is\nvolume mounted into the container. This allows OPA to load the policy from\nthe file system.\ndeployment-opa.yaml\napiVersion: extensions/v1beta1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: opa\n  labels:\n    app: opa\nspec:\n  replicas: 1\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: opa\n      name: opa\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: opa\n        image: openpolicyagent/opa:0.10.4\n        ports:\n        - name: http\n          containerPort: 8181\n        args:\n        - \"run\"\n        - \"--ignore=.*\"  # exclude hidden dirs created by Kubernetes\n        - \"--server\"\n        - \"/policies\"\n        volumeMounts:\n        - readOnly: true\n          mountPath: /policies\n          name: example-policy\n      volumes:\n      - name: example-policy\n        configMap:\n          name: example-policy\n\nkubectl create -f deployment-opa.yaml\n\nAt this point OPA is up and running. Create a Service to expose the OPA API so\nthat you can query it:\nservice-opa.yaml\nkind: Service\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n  name: opa\n  labels:\n    app: opa\nspec:\n  type: NodePort\n  selector:\n    app: opa\n  ports:\n    - name: http\n      protocol: TCP\n      port: 8181\n      targetPort: 8181\n\n\nkubectl create -f service-opa.yaml\n\nGet the URL of OPA using minikube:\nOPA_URL=$(minikube service opa --url)\n\nNow you can query OPA's API. If you use the Pod below, deny will be true\nbecause the Pod refers to image outside the corporate registry.\nexample-pod.json\n{\n    \"input\": {\n        \"kind\": \"Pod\",\n        \"apiVersion\": \"v1\",\n        \"metadata\": {\n            \"name\": \"opa\",\n            \"labels\": {\n                \"customer\": \"example.org\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"spec\": {\n            \"containers\": [\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"opa\",\n                    \"image\": \"openpolicyagent/opa\"\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\ncurl $OPA_URL/v1/data -d @example-pod.json\n\nIf you update the image to refer to the corporate registry, deny will be\nfalse.\n"},"bundles.html":{"url":"bundles.html","title":"Bundles","keywords":"","body":"Bundles\nOPA can periodically download bundles of policy and data from remote HTTP\nservers. The policies and data are loaded on the fly without requiring a\nrestart of OPA. Once the policies and data have been loaded, they are enforced\nimmediately. Policies and data loaded from bundles are accessible via the\nstandard OPA REST API.\nBundles provide an alternative to pushing policies into OPA via the REST APIs.\nBy configuring OPA to download bundles from a remote HTTP server, you can\nensure that OPA has an up-to-date copy of policies and data required for\nenforcement at all times.\nOPA can only be configured to download one bundle at a time. You\ncannot configure OPA to download multiple bundles. By default, the OPA\nREST APIs will prevent you from modifying policy and data loaded via\nbundles. If you need to load policy and data from multiple sources,\nsee the section below.\nSee the Configuration Reference for configuration details.\nBundle Service API\nOPA expects the service to expose an API endpoint that serves bundles. The\nbundle API should allow clients to download named bundles.\nGET // HTTP/1.1\n\nIf the bundle exists, the server should respond with an HTTP 200 OK status\nfollowed by a gzipped tarball in the message body.\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/gzip\n\nEnable bundle downloading via configuration. For example:\nservices:\n  - name: acmecorp\n    url: https://example.com/service/v1\n    credentials:\n      bearer:\n        token: \"bGFza2RqZmxha3NkamZsa2Fqc2Rsa2ZqYWtsc2RqZmtramRmYWxkc2tm\"\n\nbundle:\n  name: authz/bundle.tar.gz\n  prefix: somedir\n  service: acmecorp\n  polling:\n      min_delay_seconds: 10\n      max_delay_seconds: 20\n\nUsing this configuration, OPA will fetch bundles from\nhttps://example.com/service/v1/somedir/authz/bundle.tar.gz.\nThe URL is constructed as follows:\nhttps://example.com/service/v1/somedir/authz/bundle.tar.gz\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nservices[0].url                prefix  name\nIf the bundle.prefix field is not defined, the value defaults to bundles.\nSee the following section for details on the bundle file format.\nBundle File Format\nBundle files are gzipped tarballs that contain policies and data. The data\nfiles in the bundle must be organized hierarchically into directories inside\nthe tarball.\n\nThe hierarchical organization indicates to OPA where to load the data files\ninto the the data Document.\n\nYou can list the content of a bundle with tar.\n$ tar tzf bundle.tar.gz\n.manifest\nroles\nroles/bindings\nroles/bindings/data.json\nroles/permissions\nroles/permissions/data.json\nhttp\nhttp/example\nhttp/example/authz\nhttp/example/authz/authz.rego\n\nIn this example, the bundle contains one policy file (authz.rego) and two\ndata files (bindings/data.json and permissions/data.json).\nBundle files may contain an optional .manifest file that stores bundle\nmetadata. The file should contain a JSON serialized object.\n\nIf the bundle service is capable of serving different revisions of the same\nbundle, the service should include a top-level revision field containing a\nstring value that identifies the bundle revision.\n\nIf you expect to load additional data into OPA from outside the\nbundle (e.g., via OPA's HTTP API) you should include a top-level\nroots field containing of path prefixes that declare the scope of\nthe bundle. See the section below on managing data from multiple\nsources. If the roots field is not included in the manifest it\ndefaults to [\"\"] which means that ALL data and policy must come\nfrom the bundle.\n\n\nOPA will only load data files named data.json, i.e., you MUST name files\nthat contain data (which you want loaded into OPA) data.json -- otherwise\nthey will be ignored.\nMultiple Sources of Policy and Data\nBy default, when OPA is configured to download policy and data from a\nbundle service, the entire content of OPA's policy and data cache is\ndefined by the bundle. However, if you need to load OPA with policy\nand data from multiple sources, you can implement your bundle service\nto generate bundles that are scoped to a subset of OPA's policy and\ndata cache.\n\nWe recommend that whenever possible, you implement policy and data\naggregation centrally, however, in some cases that's not possible\n(e.g., due to latency requirements.)\n\nTo scope bundles to a subset of OPA's policy and data cache, include\na top-level roots key in the bundle that defines the roots of the\ndata namespace that are owned by the bundle.\nFor example, the following manifest would declare two roots\n(acmecorp/policy and acmecorp/oncall):\n{\n    \"roots\": [\"acmecorp/policy\", \"acmecorp/oncall\"]\n}\nIf OPA was loaded with a bundle containing this manifest it would only\nerase and overwrite policy and data under these roots. Policy and data\nloaded under other roots is left intact.\nWhen OPA loads scoped bundles, it validates that:\n\nThe roots are not overlapping (e.g., a/b/c and a/b are\noverlapped and will result in an error.)\n\nThe policies in the bundle are contained under the roots. This is\ndetermined by inspecting the package statement in each of the\npolicy files. For example, given the manifest above, it would be an\nerror to include a policy file containing package acmecorp.other\nbecause acmecorp.other is not contained in either of the roots.\n\nThe data in the bundle is contained under the roots.\n\n\nIf bundle validation fails, OPA will report the validation error via\nthe Status API.\nDebugging Your Bundles\nWhen you run OPA, you can provide bundle files over the command line. This\nallows you to manually check that your bundles include all of the files that\nyou intended and that they are structured correctly. For example:\nopa run bundle.tar.gz\n\n"},"status.html":{"url":"status.html","title":"Status","keywords":"","body":"Status\nOPA can periodically report status updates to remote HTTP servers.

The discovery feature helps you\ncentrally manage the OPA configuration for these features. You should use the\ndiscovery feature if you want to avoid managing OPA configuration updates in\nnumber of different locations.\nWhen the discovery feature is enabled, OPA will periodically download a\ndiscovery bundle. Like regular bundles, the discovery bundle may contain JSON\nand Rego files. OPA will evaluate the data and policies contained in the\ndiscovery bundle to generate the rest of the configuration. There are two main\nways to structure the discovery bundle:\n\nInclude static JSON configuration files that define the OPA configuration.\nInclude Rego files that can be evaluated to produce the OPA configuration.\n\n\nIf you need OPA to select which policy to download dynamically (e.g., based on\nenvironment variables like the region where OPA is running), use the second\noption.\n\nIf no discovery path is specified OPA will query the data document to produce\nthe configuration. If a discovery path is specified, OPA will translate the path\nto a reference and evaluate it relative to the data document. For example, if\nthe discovery path is /example/discovery OPA will evaluate\ndata.example.discovery to produce the configuration.\nIf discovery is enabled, other features like bundle downloading and status\nreporting cannot be configured manually. Similarly, discovered configuration\ncannot override the original discovery settings in the configuration file that\nOPA was booted with.\nSee the Configuration Reference for configuration details.\nDiscovery Service API\nOPA expects the service to expose an API endpoint that serves bundles.\nGET /// HTTP/1.1\n\nIf the bundle exists, the server should respond with an HTTP 200 OK status\nfollowed by a gzipped tarball in the message body.\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/gzip\n\nDiscovery can be enabled using the below configuration:\nservices:\n  - name: acmecorp\n    url: https://example.com/control-plane-api/v1\n    credentials:\n      bearer:\n        token: \"bGFza2RqZmxha3NkamZsa2Fqc2Rsa2ZqYWtsc2RqZmtramRmYWxkc2tm\"\n\ndiscovery:\n  name: /example/discovery\n  prefix: configuration\n\nOPA will fetch it's configuration from\nhttps://example.com/control-plane-api/v1/configuration/example/discovery and\nuse that to initialize the other plugins like bundles, status, decision\nlogs. The prefix field is optional and by default set to bundles. Hence if\nprefix is not provided, OPA will fetch it's configuration from\nhttps://example.com/control-plane-api/v1/bundles/example/discovery.\nBelow is an example of how configuration for decision logs can be included\ninside a policy file.\nexample.rego\npackage example\n\ndiscovery = {\n  \"decision_logs\": {\n    \"service\": \"acmecorp\"\n  }\n}\n\nThe same configuration can also  be provided as data.\ndata.json\n\"example\": {\n  \"discovery\": {\n    \"decision_logs\": {\n      \"service\": \"acmecorp\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nIn both cases, OPA's configuration is hierarchically organized under the\ndiscovery.name value. If discovery is enabled, the service field in the\nbundles, status, decision logs plugins is optional and will default to one\nof the services from the discovery configuration.\nExample\nLet's see an example of how the discovery feature can be used to dynamically configure an OPA to download one of two bundles based on a configuration label that the OPA was started with. Let's say the label region indicates the region in which the OPA is running and it's value will decide the bundle to download.\nBelow is a policy file which includes the bundle congfiguration.\nexample.rego\npackage example\n\ndiscovery = {\n  \"bundle\": {\n    \"name\": bundle_name\n  }\n}\n\nrt = opa.runtime()\nregion = rt.config.labels.region\nbundle_name = region_bundle[region]\n\n# region-bundle information\nregion_bundle = {\n  \"US\": \"example/test1/p\",\n  \"UK\": \"example/test2/p\"\n}\n\nThe bundle_name variable in line 5 of the above policy will be dynamically selected based on the value of the label region. So if an OPA was started with region: \"US\", then the bundle_name will be example/test1/p.\nStart an OPA with a configuration as shown below:\nconfig.yaml\nservices:\n  - name: acmecorp\n    url: https://example.com/control-plane-api/v1\n    credentials:\n      bearer:\n        token: \"bGFza2RqZmxha3NkamZsa2Fqc2Rsa2ZqYWtsc2RqZmtramRmYWxkc2tm\"\n\ndiscovery:\n  name: /example/discovery\n\nlabels:\n  region: \"US\"\n\nRun OPA:\nopa run -s -c config.yaml\n\nYou should see a log like below, which shows the bundle being downloaded. In this case, the bundle name is example/test1/p as region is US.\nINFO Bundle downloaded and activated successfully. name=example/test1/p plugin=bundle\n\nNow start another OPA with a configuration as shown below. Notice the region is UK:\nconfig.yaml\nservices:\n  - name: acmecorp\n    url: https://example.com/control-plane-api/v1\n    credentials:\n      bearer:\n        token: \"bGFza2RqZmxha3NkamZsa2Fqc2Rsa2ZqYWtsc2RqZmtramRmYWxkc2tm\"\n\ndiscovery:\n  name: /example/discovery\n\nlabels:\n  region: \"UK\"\n\nRun OPA:\nopa run -s -c config.yaml\n\nIn this case, the bundle being downloaded is example/test2/p as region is UK.\nINFO Bundle downloaded and activated successfully. name=example/test2/p plugin=bundle\n\nThis shows how the discovery feature can help in centrally managing the bundle to be downloaded by an OPA based on a configuration label. You can use the same strategy to dynamically configure other plugins based on the running OPA's configuration labels or environment variables.\nLimitations\nThe discovery feature cannot be used to dynamically modify services, labels and discovery. This means that these configuration settings should be included in the bootup configuration file provided to OPA.\n"},"security.html":{"url":"security.html","title":"Security","keywords":"","body":"Security\nThis document provides guidelines for deploying OPA inside untrusted\nenvironments. You should read this document if you are deploying OPA as a\nservice.\nSecuring the API involves configuring OPA to use TLS, authentication, and\nauthorization so that:\n\nTraffic between OPA and clients is encrypted.\nClients verify the OPA API endpoint identity.\nOPA verifies client identities.\nClients are only granted access to specific APIs or sections of The data Document.\n\nTLS and HTTPS\nHTTPS is configured by specifying TLS credentials via command line flags at\nstartup:\n\n--tls-cert-file= specifies the path of the file containing the TLS certificate.\n--tls-private-key-file= specifies the path of the file containing the TLS private key.\n\nOPA will exit immediately with a non-zero status code if only one of these flags\nis specified.\nNote that for using TLS-based authentication, a CA cert file can be provided:\n\n--tls-ca-cert-file= specifies the path of the file containing the CA cert.\n\nIf provided, it will be used to validate clients' TLS certificates when using TLS\nauthentication (see below).\nBy default, OPA ignores insecure HTTP connections when TLS is enabled. To allow\ninsecure HTTP connections in addition to HTTPS connections, provide another\nlistening address with --addr. For example:\nopa run --server \\\n  --log-level debug \\\n  --tls-cert-file public.crt \\\n  --tls-private-key-file private.key \\\n  --addr https://0.0.0.0:8181 \\\n  --addr http://localhost:8282\n\n1.

DO NOT\nrely on self-signed certificates outside of development without understanding\nthe risks.\n\n2. Start OPA with TLS enabled\nopa run --server --log-level debug \\\n    --tls-cert-file public.crt \\\n    --tls-private-key-file private.key\n\n3. Try to access the API with HTTP\ncurl http://localhost:8181/v1/data\n\n4. Access the API with HTTPS\ncurl -k https://localhost:8181/v1/data\n\n\nWe have to use cURL's -k/--insecure flag because we are using a\nself-signed certificate.\n\nAuthentication and Authorization\nThis section shows how to configure OPA to authenticate and authorize client\nrequests. Client-side authentication of the OPA API endpoint should be handled\nwith TLS.\nAuthentication and authorization allow OPA to:\n\nVerify client identities.\nControl client access to APIs and data.\n\nBoth are configured via command line flags:\n\n--authentication= specifies the authentication scheme to use.\n--authorization= specifies the authorization scheme to use.\n\nBy default, OPA does not perform authentication or authorization and these flags\ndefault to off.\nFor authentication, OPA supports:\n\nBearer tokens: Bearer tokens are enabled by\nstarting OPA with --authentication=token. When the token authentication\nmode is enabled, OPA will extract the Bearer token from incoming API requests\nand provide to the authorization handler. When you use the token\nauthentication, you must configure an authorization policy that checks the\ntokens. If the client does not supply a Bearer token, the input.identity\nvalue will be undefined when the authorization policy is evaluated.\nClient TLS certificates: Client TLS authentication is enabled by starting\nOPA with --authentication=tls. When this authentication mode is enabled,\nOPA will require all clients to provide a client certificate. It is verified\nagainst the CA certificate(s) provided via --tls-ca-cert-path. Upon successful\nverification, the input.identity value is set to the TLS certificate's\nsubject.\nNote that TLS authentication does not disable non-HTTPS listeners. To ensure\nthat all your communication is secured, it should be paired with an\nauthorization policy (see below) that at least requires the client identity\n(input.identity) to be set.\n\n\nFor authorization, OPA relies on policy written in Rego. Authorization is\nenabled by starting OPA with --authorization=basic.\nWhen the basic authorization scheme is enabled, a minimal authorization policy\nmust be provided on startup. The authorization policy must be structured as follows:\n# The \"system\" namespace is reserved for internal use\n# by OPA. Authorization policy must be defined under\n# system.authz as follows:\npackage system.authz\n\ndefault allow = false  # Reject requests by default.\n\nallow {\n  # Logic to authorize request goes here.\n}\n\nWhen OPA receives a request, it executes a query against the document defined\ndata.system.authz.allow. The implementation of the policy may span multiple\npackages however it is recommended that administrators keep the policy under the\nsystem namespace.\nIf the document produced by the allow rule is true, the request is\nprocessed normally. If the document is undefined or not true, the\nrequest is rejected immediately.\nOPA provides the following input document when executing the authorization\npolicy:\n{\n    \"input\": {\n        # Identity established by authentication scheme.\n        # When Bearer tokens are used, the identity is\n        # set to the Bearer token value.\n        \"identity\": ,\n\n        # One of {GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE}.\n        \"method\": ,\n\n        # URL path represented as an array.\n        # For example: /v1/data/exempli-gratia\n        # is represented as [v1, data, exampli-gratia]\n        \"path\": ,\n    }\n}\n\nAt a minimum, the authorization policy should grant access to a special root\nidentity:\npackage system.authz\n\ndefault allow = false          # Reject requests by default.\n\nallow {                        # Allow request if...\n    \"secret\" = input.identity  # Identity is the secret root key.\n}\n\nWhen OPA is configured with this minimal authorization policy, requests without\nauthentication are rejected:\nGET /v1/policies HTTP/1.1\n\nResponse:\nHTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  \"code\": \"unauthorized\",\n  \"message\": \"request rejected by administrative policy\"\n}\n\nHowever, if Bearer token authentication is enabled and the request includes the\nsecret from above, the request is allowed:\nGET /v1/policies HTTP/1.1\nAuthorization: Bearer secret\n\nResponse:\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json\n\nToken-based Authentication Example\nWhen Bearer tokens are used for authentication, the policy should at minimum\nvalidate the identity:\npackage system.authz\n\n# Tokens may defined in policy or pushed into OPA as data.\ntokens = {\n    \"my-secret-token-foo\": {\n        \"roles\": [\"admin\"]\n    },\n    \"my-secret-token-bar\": {\n        \"roles\": [\"service-1\"]\n    },\n    \"my-secret-token-baz\": {\n        \"roles\": [\"service-2\", \"service-3\"]\n    }\n}\n\ndefault allow = false          # Reject requests by default.\n\nallow {                        # Allow request if...\n    input.identity = \"secret\"  # Identity is the secret root key.\n}\n\nallow {                        # Allow request if...\n    tokens[input.identity]     # Identity exists in \"tokens\".\n}\n\nTo complete this example, the policy could further restrict tokens to specific\ndocuments:\npackage system.authz\n\n# Rights may be defined in policy or pushed into OPA as data.\nrights = {\n    \"admin\": {\n        \"path\": \"*\"\n    },\n    \"service-1\": {\n        \"path\": [\"v1\", \"data\", \"exempli\", \"gratia\"]\n    },\n    \"service-2\": {\n        \"path\": [\"v1\", \"data\", \"par\", \"example\"]\n    }\n}\n\n# Tokens may be defined in policy or pushed into OPA as data.\ntokens = {\n    \"my-secret-token-foo\": {\n        \"roles\": [\"admin\"]\n    },\n    \"my-secret-token-bar\": {\n        \"roles\": [\"service-1\"]\n    },\n    \"my-secret-token-baz\": {\n        \"roles\": [\"service-2\", \"service-3\"]\n    }\n}\n\ndefault allow = false               # Reject requests by default.\n\nallow {                             # Allow request if...\n    identity_rights[right]          # Rights for identity exist, and...\n    right.path = \"*\"                # Right.path is '*'.\n} {                                 # Or...\n    identity_rights[right]          # Rights for identity exist, and...\n    right.path = input.path         # Right.path matches input.path.\n}\n\nidentity_rights[right] {            # Right is in the identity_rights set if...\n    token = tokens[input.identity]  # Token exists for identity, and...\n    role = token.roles[_]           # Token has a role, and...\n    right = rights[role]            # Role has rights defined.\n}\n\nTLS-based Authentication Example\nTo set up authentication based on TLS, we will need three certificates:\n\nthe CA cert (self-signed),\nthe server cert (signed by the CA), and\nthe client cert (signed by the CA).\n\nThese are example invocations using openssl.\nDon't use these in production, the key sizes are only good for demonstration purposes.\nNote that we're creating an extra client, which has a certificate signed by the proper\nCA, but will later be used to illustrate the authorization policy.\n# CA\nopenssl genrsa -out ca-key.pem 2048\nopenssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key ca-key.pem -days 1000 -out ca.pem -subj \"/CN=my-ca\"\n\n# client 1\nopenssl genrsa -out client-key.pem 2048\nopenssl req -new -key client-key.pem -out csr.pem -subj \"/CN=my-client\"\nopenssl x509 -req -in csr.pem -CA ca.pem -CAkey ca-key.pem -CAcreateserial -out client-cert.pem -days 1000\n\n# client 2\nopenssl genrsa -out client-key-2.pem 2048\nopenssl req -new -key client-key-2.pem -out csr.pem -subj \"/CN=my-client-2\"\nopenssl x509 -req -in csr.pem -CA ca.pem -CAkey ca-key.pem -CAcreateserial -out client-cert-2.pem -days 1000\n\n# create server cert with IP and DNS SANs\ncat req.cnf\n[req]\nreq_extensions = v3_req\ndistinguished_name = req_distinguished_name\n\n[req_distinguished_name]\n\n[v3_req]\nbasicConstraints = CA:FALSE\nkeyUsage = nonRepudiation, digitalSignature, keyEncipherment\nsubjectAltName = @alt_names\n\n[alt_names]\nDNS.1 = opa.example.com\nIP.1 = 127.0.0.1\nEOF\nopenssl genrsa -out server-key.pem 2048\nopenssl req -new -key server-key.pem -out csr.pem -subj \"/CN=my-server\" -config req.cnf\nopenssl x509 -req -in csr.pem -CA ca.pem -CAkey ca-key.pem -CAcreateserial -out server-cert.pem -days 1000 -extensions v3_req -extfile req.cnf\n\nWe also create a simple authorization policy file, called check.rego:\npackage system.authz\n\n# client_cns may defined in policy or pushed into OPA as data.\nclient_cns = {\n    \"my-client\": true\n}\n\ndefault allow = false\n\nallow {                                        #

To implement a custom plugin you must implement two\ninterfaces:\n\ngithub.com/open-policy-agent/opa/plugins#Factory to instantiate your plugin.\ngithub.com/open-policy-agent/opa/plugins#Plugin to provide your plugin behavior.\n\nYou can register your factory with OPA by calling github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/runtime#RegisterPlugin inside your Init function.\nPutting It Together\nThe example below shows how you can implement a custom Decision Logger\nthat writes events to a stream (e.g., stdout/stderr).\ntype Config struct {\n    Stderr bool `json:\"stderr\"` // false => stdout, true => stderr\n}\n\ntype PrintlnLogger struct {\n    mtx sync.Mutex\n    config Config\n}\n\nfunc (p *PrintlnLogger) Start(ctx context.Context) error {\n    // No-op.\n    return nil\n}\n\nfunc (p *PrintlnLogger) Stop(ctx context.Context) {\n    // No-op.\n}\n\nfunc (p *PrintlnLogger) Reconfigure(ctx context.Context, config interface{}) {\n    p.mtx.Lock()\n    defer p.mtx.Unlock()\n    p.config = config.(Config)\n}\n\nfunc (p *PrintlnLogger) Log(ctx context.Context, event logs.EventV1) {\n    p.mtx.Lock()\n    defer p.mtx.Unlock()\n    w := os.Stdout\n    if p.config.Stderr {\n        w = os.Stderr\n    }\n    fmt.Fprintln(w, event) // ignoring errors!\n}\n\nNext, implement a factory function that instantiates your plugin:\ntype Factory struct{}\n\nfunc (Factory) New(_ *plugins.Manager, config interface{}) plugins.Plugin {\n    return &PrintlnLogger{\n        config: config.(Config),\n    }\n}\n\nfunc (Factory) Validate(_ *plugins.Manager, config []byte) (interface{}, error) {\n    parsedConfig := Config{}\n    return parsedConfig, util.Unmarshal(config, &parsedConfig)\n}\n\nFinally, register your factory with OPA:\nfunc Init() {\n    runtime.RegisterPlugin(\"println_decision_logger\", Factory{})\n}\n\nTo test your plugin, build a shared object file:\ngo build -buildmode=plugin -o=plugin.so main.go\nDefine an OPA configuration file that will use your plugin:\nconfig.yaml:\ndecision_logs:\n  plugin: println_decision_logger\nplugins:\n  println_decision_logger:\n    stderr: false\n\nStart OPA with the plugin directory and configuration file:\nopa --plugin-dir $PWD run --server --config-file config.yaml\n\nExercise the plugin via the OPA API:\ncurl localhost:8181/v1/data\nIf everything worked you will see the Go struct representation of the decision\nlog event written to stdout.\nThe source code for this example can be found here.\n"},"faq.html":{"url":"faq.html","title":"FAQ","keywords":"","body":"Frequently Asked Questions\nHow do I make user attributes stored in LDAP/AD available to OPA for making decisions?\nThis best-practice guide explains three options: JSON Web Tokens, synchronization with LDAP/AD, and calling into LDAP/AD during policy evaluation.\nHow does OPA do conflict resolution?\nIn Rego (OPA's policy language), you can write statements that both allow and\ndeny a request, such as\npackage foo\nallow { input.name = \"alice\" }\ndeny { input.name = \"alice\" }\nNeither allow nor deny are keywords in Rego so if you want to treat them\nas contradictory, you control which one takes precedence explicitly.  When you ask for\na policy decision from OPA, you specify both the policy name (foo) and the\nvirtual document that names the decision within foo.  Typically in this scenario,\nyou create a virtual document called authz and define it so that allow\noverrides deny or vice versa.  Then when asking for a policy decision, you\nask for foo/authz.\n# deny everything by default\ndefault authz = false\n\n# deny overrides allow\nauthz {\n    allow\n    not deny\n}\nIf instead you want to resolve conflicts using a first-match strategy (where\nthe first statement applicable makes the decision), see the FAQ entry on\nstatement order.\nDoes Statement Order Matter?\nThe order in which statements occur does not matter in Rego.  Reorder any two statements\nand the policy means exactly the same thing.  For example, the following two statements\nmean the same thing whichever order you write them in.\nratelimit = 4 { input.name = \"alice\" }\nratelimit = 5 { input.owner = \"bob\" }\nSometimes, though, you want the statement order to matter.  For example, you might put more specific statements before more general statements so that the more specific statements take precedence (e.g. for conflict resolution).  Rego lets you do that using the else keyword.  For example, if you want to make the first statement above take precedence, you would write the following Rego.\nratelimit = 4 {\n    input.name = \"alice\"\n} else = 5 {\n    input.owner = \"bob\"\n}\n"},"comparison-to-other-systems.html":{"url":"comparison-to-other-systems.html","title":"Comparison to Other Systems","keywords":"","body":"Comparison to Other Systems\nOften the easiest way to understand a new language is by comparing\nit to languages you already know.  Here we show how policies from\nseveral existing policy systems can be implemented with the Open\nPolicy Agent.\nRole-based access control (RBAC)\nRole-based access control (RBAC) is pervasive today for authorization.\nTo use RBAC for authorization, you write down two different kinds of\ninformation.\n\nWhich users have which roles\nWhich roles have which permissions\n\nOnce you provide RBAC with both those assignments, RBAC tells you\nhow to make an authorization decision.  A user is authorized for\nall those permissions assigned to any of the roles she is assigned to.\nFor example, we might have the following user/role assignments:\n\n\n\nUser\nRole\n\n\n\n\nalice\nengineering\n\n\nalice\nwebdev\n\n\nbob\nhr\n\n\n\nAnd the following role/permission assignments:\n\n\n\nRole\nPermission\nResource\n\n\n\n\nengineering\nread\nserver123\n\n\nwebdev\nwrite\nserver123\n\n\nwebdev\nread\nserver123\n\n\nhr\nwrite\ndatabase456\n\n\n\nIn this example, RBAC makes the following authorization decisions:\n\n\n\nUser\nOperation\nResource\nDecision\n\n\n\n\nalice\nread\nserver123\nallow because alice is in engineering\n\n\nalice\nwrite\nserver123\nallow because alice is in webdev\n\n\nbob\nread\ndatabase456\nallow because bob is in hr\n\n\nbob\nread\nserver123\ndeny because bob is not in engineering or webdev\n\n\n\nWith OPA, you can write the following snippets to implement the\nexample RBAC policy shown above.\npackage rbac.authz\n\n# Policy decisions are made using the following input\n#   Not part of the policy but good as documentation\n# input = {\n#     \"user\": \"bob\",\n#     \"action\": \"read\",\n#     \"object\": \"server123\"\n# }\n\n# user-role assignments\nuser_roles = {\n    \"alice\": [\"engineering\", \"webdev\"],\n    \"bob\": [\"hr\"]\n}\n\n# role-permissions assignments\nrole_permissions = {\n    \"engineering\": [{\"action\": \"read\",  \"object\": \"server123\"}],\n    \"webdev\":      [{\"action\": \"read\",  \"object\": \"server123\"},\n                    {\"action\": \"write\", \"object\": \"server123\"}],\n    \"hr\":          [{\"action\": \"read\",  \"object\": \"database456\"}]\n}\n\n# logic that implements RBAC.\ndefault allow = false\nallow {\n    # lookup the list of roles for the user\n    roles = user_roles[input.user]\n    # for each role in that list\n    r = roles[_]\n    # lookup the permissions list for role r\n    permissions = role_permissions[r]\n    # for each permission\n    p = permissions[_]\n    # check if the permission granted to r matches the user's request\n    #    Note: equality (=) works for both assignment and comparison\n    {\"action\": input.action, \"object\": input.object} = p\n}\n\nRBAC Separation of duty (SOD)\nSeparation of duty (SOD) refers to the idea that there are certain\ncombinations of permissions that no one should have at the same time.\nFor example, no one should be able to both create payments and approve payments.\nIn RBAC, that means there are some pairs of roles that no one should be\nassigned simultaneously.  For example, any user assigned both of the roles\nin each pair below would violate SOD.\n\ncreate-payment and approve-payment\ncreate-vendor and pay-vendor\n\nOPA's API does not yet let you enforce SOD by rejecting improper role-assignments,\nbut it does let you express SOD constraints and ask for all SOD violations,\nas shown below.  (Here we assume the statements below are added to the RBAC\nstatements above.)\n# Pairs of roles that no user can be assigned to simultaneously\nsod_roles = [\n    [\"create-payment\", \"approve-payment\"],\n    [\"create-vendor\", \"pay-vendor\"]\n]\n\n# Find all users violating SOD\nsod_violation[user] {\n    # grab one role for a user\n    role1 = user_role[user][_]\n    # grab another role for that same user\n    role2 = user_role[user][_]\n    # check if those roles are forbidden by SOD\n    sod_roles[_] = [role1, role2]\n}\n\n(For those familiar with SOD, this is the static version since SOD violations\nhappen whenever a user is assigned two conflicting roles.  The dynamic version of SOD allows\na single user to be assigned two conflicting roles but requires that the same user not\nutilize those roles on the same transaction, which is out of scope for this document.)\nAttribute-based access control (ABAC)\nWith attribute-based access control, you make policy decisions using the\nattributes of the users, objects, and actions involved in the request.\nIt has three main components:\n\nAttributes for users\nAttributes for objects\nLogic dictating which attribute combinations are authorized\n\nFor example, we might know the following attributes for our users\n\nalice\njoined the company 15 years ago\nis a trader\n\n\nbob\njoined the company 5 years ago\nis an analyst\n\n\n\nWe would also have attributes for the objects, in this case stock ticker symbols.\n\nMSFT\nis sold on NASDAQ\nsells at $59.20 per share\n\n\nAMZN\nis sold on NASDAQ\nsells at $813.64 per share\n\n\n\nAn example ABAC policy in english might be:\n\nTraders may purchase NASDAQ stocks for under $2M\nTraders with 10+ years experience may purchase NASDAQ stocks for under $5M\n\nOPA supports ABAC policies as shown below.\npackage abac\n\n# Sample input\n# input = {\n#    \"user\": \"alice\",\n#    \"ticker\": \"MSFT\",\n#    \"action\": \"buy\",\n#    \"amount\": 1000000\n# }\n\n# User attributes\nuser_attributes = {\n    \"alice\": {\"tenure\": 15, \"title\": \"trader\"},\n    \"bob\": {\"tenure\": 5, \"title\": \"analyst\"}\n}\n\n# Stock attributes\nticker_attributes = {\n    \"MSFT\": {\"exchange\": \"NASDAQ\", \"price\": 59.20},\n    \"AMZN\": {\"exchange\": \"NASDAQ\", \"price\": 813.64}\n}\n\n# all traders may buy NASDAQ under $2M\nallow {\n    # lookup the user's attributes\n    user = user_attributes[input.user]\n    # check that the user is a trader\n    user.title = \"trader\"\n    # check that the stock being purchased is sold on the NASDAQ\n    ticker_attributes[input.ticker].exchange = \"NASDAQ\"\n    # check that the purchase amount is under $2M\n    input.amount  10\n    # check that the purchase amount is under $5M\n    input.amount \nIn OPA, there's nothing special about users and objects.  You can attach\nattributes to anything.  And the attributes can themselves be structured JSON objects\nand have attributes on attributes on attributes.  Because OPA was designed to work\nwith arbitrarily nested JSON data, it supports incredibly rich ABAC policies.\nAmazon Web Services IAM\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) lets you create policies that you attach to users, roles, groups,\nand resources.  You write allow and deny statements to decide which users can\nexecute which API calls on which resources.  By default all API access is denied;\npolicy statements can explicitly allow API access.  If an API is both allowed and\ndenied, it is always denied.\n{\n  \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n  \"Statement\": [\n    {\n      \"Sid\": \"FirstStatement\",\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n      \"Action\": [\"iam:ChangePassword\"],\n      \"Resource\": \"*\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"Sid\": \"SecondStatement\",\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n      \"Action\": \"s3:ListAllMyBuckets\",\n      \"Resource\": \"*\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"Sid\": \"ThirdStatement\",\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n      \"Action\": [\n        \"s3:List*\",\n        \"s3:Get*\"\n      ],\n      \"Resource\": [\n        \"arn:aws:s3:::confidential-data\",\n        \"arn:aws:s3:::confidential-data/*\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nIn OPA, you write each of the AWS allow statements as a separate statement, and you\nexpect the input to have user, action, and resource fields.\npackage aws\n\n# input = {\n#     \"user\": \"alice\",\n#     \"action\": \"ec2:StartInstance\"\n#     \"resource\": \"arn:aws:ec2:::instance/i78999879\"\n# }\n\n# FirstStatement\nallow {\n    input.action = \"iam:ChangePassword\"\n}\n\n# SecondStatement\nallow {\n    input.action = \"s3:ListAllMyBuckets\"\n}\n\n# ThirdStatement\n#  Use helpers to handle implicit OR in the AWS policy.\n#  Below both 'actions_match' and 'resources_match' must be true.\nallow {\n    actions_match\n    resources_match\n}\n\n# actions_match is true if input.action matches one in the list\nactions_match {\n    # iterate over the actions in the list\n    actions = [\"s3:List*\",\"s3:Get*\"]\n    action = actions[_]\n    # check if input.action matches an action\n    regex.globs_match(input.action, action)\n}\n\n# resources_match is true if input.resource matches one in the list\nresources_match {\n    # iterate over the resources in the list\n    resources = [\"arn:aws:s3:::confidential-data\",\"arn:aws:s3:::confidential-data/*\"]\n    resource = resources[_]\n    # check if input.resource matches a resource\n    regex.globs_match(input.resource, resource)\n}\n\nXACML\neXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) was designed to express security policies: allow/deny decisions  using attributes of users, resources, actions, and the environment.\nThe following policy says that users from the organization Curtiss or Packard who are US or GreatBritain nationals and who work on DetailedDesign or Simulation are permitted access to documents about NavigationSystems.\n\n  Policy for Business Authorization category TAA-1.1\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          NavigationSystem\n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n            Any\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n          Curtiss\n          Packard\n        \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          US\n          GB\n        \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          DetailedDesign\n          Simulation\n        \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nThe same statement is shown below in OPA.

Using OPA, you can offload policy\ndecisions from your service such as:\n\nShould this API call be allowed? E.g., true or false.\nHow much quota remains for this user? E.g., 1048.\nWhich hosts can this container be deployed on? E.g., [\"host1\", \"host40\", ..., \"host329\"].\nWhat updates must be applied to this resource? E.g., {\"labels\": {\"team\": \"products}}.\n\nThis tutorial shows how to get started with OPA using an interactive shell or REPL (read-eval-print loop).\nGoals\nREPLs are great for learning new languages and running quick experiments. You\ncan use OPA's REPL to experiment with policies and prototype new ones.\nTo introduce the REPL, you will use dummy data and an example policy. In English, the policy can be stated as follows:\n\nServers that open an unencrypted HTTP port must not be connected to a public network.\n\nInside the REPL, you will define rules that codify the policy stated above.\nOnce you finish this tutorial, you will be familiar with:\n\nRunning OPA as an interactive shell/REPL.\nWriting ad-hoc queries in Rego.\n\nPrerequisites\nIf this is your first time using OPA, download the latest executable for your system.\nOn macOS (64-bit):\ncurl -L -o opa https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/releases/download/v0.10.4/opa_darwin_amd64\n\nOn Linux (64-bit):\ncurl -L -o opa https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/releases/download/v0.10.4/opa_linux_amd64\n\n\nWindows users can obtain the OPA executable from GitHub Releases. The steps below are the same for Windows users except the executable name will be different.\n\nSet permissions on the OPA executable:\nchmod 755 ./opa\n\nSteps\n1. Make sure you can run the REPL on your machine.\n./opa run\n\nWithout any data, you can experiment with simple expressions to get the hang of it:\n> true\ntrue\n> 3.14\n3.14\n> [\"hello\", \"world\"]\n[\n  \"hello\",\n  \"world\"\n]\n\nYou can also test simple boolean expressions:\n> true == false\nfalse\n> 3.14 > 3\ntrue\n> \"hello\" != \"goodbye\"\ntrue\n\nMost REPLs let you define variables that you can reference later on. OPA allows you to do something similar. For example, you can define a pi constant as follows:\n> pi = 3.14\n\nOnce \"pi\" is defined, you query for the value and write expressions in terms of it:\n> pi\n3.14\n> pi > 3\ntrue\n\nOne thing to watch out for in the REPL is that = is used both for assigning variables values and for testing the value of variables. For example p = q sometimes assigns p the value of q and sometimes checks if the values of p and q are the same. The REPL decides between assignment and test based on whether p already has a value or not. If p has a value, p = q is a test (returning true or false), and if p has no value p = q is an assignment. To unset a value for a variable, use the unset command. (This ambiguity is only really an issue in the REPL. When writing policy, the duality of = is actually beneficial.)\n> pi = 3\nundefined\n> unset pi\n> pi = 3\n> pi\n3\n\nIn addition to running queries, the REPL also lets you define rules:\n> items = [\"pizza\", \"apples\", \"bread\", \"coffee\"]\n> users = {\"bob\": {\"likes\": [0, 2]}, \"alice\": {\"likes\": [1, 2, 3]}}\n> likes[[name, item]] { index = users[name].likes[_]; item = items[index] }\n\nThe likes rule above defines a set of tuples specifying what each user likes.\n> likes[[\"alice\", item]] # what does alice like?\n+----------+\n|   item   |\n+----------+\n| \"apples\" |\n| \"bread\"  |\n| \"coffee\" |\n+----------+\n> likes[[name, \"bread\"]] # who likes bread?\n+---------+\n|  name   |\n+---------+\n| \"bob\"   |\n| \"alice\" |\n+---------+\nWhen you enter expressions into the OPA REPL, you are effectively running queries. The REPL output shows the values of variables in the expression that make the query true. If there is no set of variables that would make the query true, the REPL prints undefined. If there are no variables in the query and the query evaluates successfully, then the REPL just prints true.\nQuit out of the REPL by pressing Control-D or typing exit:\n> exit\nExiting\n\n2. Create a data file and a policy module.\nLet's define a bit of JSON data that will be used in the tutorial:\ncat >data.json \nAlso, let's include a rule that defines a set of servers that are attached to public networks:\ncat >example.rego \n3.

But many users\nrequire finer-grained access control and Docker’s plugin infrastructure allows\nus to do so.\nThis is an excellent opportunity to see how to policy enable an existing\nservice.\nGoals\nThis tutorial helps you get started with OPA and introduces you to core concepts\nin OPA.\n\nPolicy enabling an application decouples the policy implementation from the\nbusiness logic so that administrators can define policy without changing the\napplication while still keeping up with the size, complexity, and dynamic\nnature of modern applications.\n\nFor the purpose of this tutorial, we want to use OPA to enforce a policy that\nprevents users from running insecure containers.\nThis tutorial illustrates two key concepts:\n\nOPA policy definition is decoupled from the implementation of the service\n(in this case Docker). The administrator is empowered to define and manage\npolicies without requiring changes to any of the apps.\n\nBoth the data relevant to policy and the policy definitions themselves can\nchange rapidly.\n\n\nPrerequisites\nThis tutorial requires:\n\nDocker Engine 18.06.0-ce or newer\nDocker API version 1.38 or newer\nroot or sudo access\n\nThe tutorial has been tested on the following platforms:\n\nUbuntu 18.04 (64-bit)\n\nIf you are using a different distro, OS, or architecture, the steps will be the\nsame. However, there may be slight differences in the commands you need to run.\nSteps\nSeveral of the steps below require root or sudo access. When you are\nmodifying files under /etc/docker or signalling the Docker daemon to\nrestart, you will need root access.\n1. Create an empty policy definition that will allow all requests.\nmkdir -p /etc/docker/policies\ncat >/etc/docker/policies/authz.rego \nThis policy defines a single rule named allow that always produces the\ndecision true. Once all of the components are running, we will come back to\nthe policy.\n2. Install the opa-docker-authz plugin.\ndocker plugin install openpolicyagent/opa-docker-authz-v2:0.4 opa-args=\"-policy-file /opa/policies/authz.rego\"\n\nYou need to configure the Docker daemon to use the plugin for authorization.\ncat > /etc/docker/daemon.json \nSignal the Docker daemon to reload the configuration file.\nkill -HUP $(pidof dockerd)\n\n4. Run a simple Docker command to make sure everything is still working.\ndocker ps\n\nIf everything is setup correctly, the command should exit successfully. You can\nexpect to see log messages from OPA and the plugin.\n5. Test that the policy definition is working.\nLet’s modify our policy to deny all requests:\ncat >/etc/docker/policies/authz.rego \nIn OPA, rules defines the content of documents. Documents be boolean values\n(true/false) or they can represent more complex structures using arrays,\nobjects, strings, etc.\nIn the example above we modified the policy to always return false so that\nrequests will be rejected.\ndocker ps\n\nThe output should be:\nError response from daemon: authorization denied by plugin opa-docker-authz: request rejected by administrative policy\n\nTo learn more about how rules define the content of documents, see: How Does OPA Work?\nWith this policy in place, users will not be able to run any Docker commands. Go\nahead and try other commands such as docker run or docker pull. They will\nall be rejected.\nNow let's change the policy so that it's a bit more useful.\n6. Update the policy to reject requests with the unconfined seccomp profile:\ncat >/etc/docker/policies/authz.rego \n7. Test the policy is working by running a simple container:\ndocker run hello-world\n\nNow try running the same container but disable seccomp (which should be\nprevented by the policy):\ndocker run --security-opt seccomp:unconfined hello-world\n\nCongratulations! You have successfully prevented containers from running without\nseccomp!\nThe rest of the tutorial shows how you can grant fine grained access to specific\nclients.\n 8. Identify the user in Docker requests.\n\nBack up your existing Docker configuration, just in case. You can replace your\noriginal configuration after you are done with the tutorial.\n\nmkdir -p ~/.docker\ncp ~/.docker/config.json ~/.docker/config.json~\n\nTo identify the user, include an HTTP header in all of the requests sent to the\nDocker daemon:\ncat >~/.docker/config.json \n\nDocker does not currently provide a way to authenticate clients. But in Docker\n1.12, clients can be authenticated using TLS and there are plans to include\nother means of authentication. For the purpose of this tutorial, we assume that\nan authentication system is place.\n\n9. Update the policy to include basic user access controls.\ncat >/etc/docker/policies/authz.rego \n10. Attempt to run a container.\nBecause the configured user is \"bob\", the request is rejected:\ndocker run hello-world\n\n11. Change the user to \"alice\" and re-run the container.\ncat > ~/.docker/config.json \nBecause the configured user is \"alice\", the request will succeed:\ndocker run hello-world\n\nThat's it!\n"},"http-api-authorization.html":{"url":"http-api-authorization.html","title":"HTTP API Authorization","keywords":"","body":"HTTP API Authorization\nAnything that exposes an HTTP API (whether an individual microservice or an application as a whole) needs to control who can run those APIs and when.  OPA makes it easy to write fine-grained, context-aware policies to implement API authorization.\nGoals\nIn this tutorial, you'll use a simple HTTP web server that accepts any HTTP GET\nrequest that you issue and echoes the OPA decision back as text. Both OPA and\nthe web server will be run as containers.\nFor this tutorial, our desired policy is:\n\nPeople can see their own salaries (GET /finance/salary/{user} is permitted for {user})\nA manager can see their direct reports' salaries (GET /finance/salary/{user} is permitted for {user}'s manager)\n\nPrerequisites\nThis tutorial requires Docker Compose to run a demo web server along with OPA.\nSteps\n1. Bootstrap the tutorial environment using Docker Compose.\nFirst, create a docker-compose.yml file that runs OPA and the demo web server.\ndocker-compose.yml:\nversion: '2'\nservices:\n  opa:\n    image: openpolicyagent/opa:0.10.4\n    ports:\n      - 8181:8181\n    # WARNING: OPA is NOT running with an authorization policy configured.

An example code is here,\nbut the crux of the (Python) code is shown below.\n\n# Grab basic information. We assume user is passed on a form.\nhttp_api_user = request.form['user']\n\n# Get the path as a list (removing leading and trailing /)\n# Example: \"/finance/salary/\" will become [\"finance\", \"salary\"]\nhttp_api_path_list = request.path.strip(\"/\").split(\"/\")\n\ninput_dict = {  # create input to hand to OPA\n    \"input\": {\n        \"user\": http_api_user,\n        \"path\": http_api_path_list, # Ex: [\"finance\", \"salary\", \"alice\"]\n        \"method\": request.method  # HTTP verb, e.g. GET, POST, PUT, ...\n    }\n}\n# ask OPA for a policy decision\n# (in reality OPA URL would be constructed from environment)\nrsp = requests.post(\"http://127.0.0.1:8181/v1/data/httpapi/authz\", json=input_dict)\nif rsp.json()[\"allow\"]:\n  # HTTP API allowed\nelse:\n  # HTTP API denied\n\n2. Load a policy into OPA.\nIn another terminal, create a policy that allows users to\nrequest their own salary as well as the salary of their direct subordinates.\ncat >example.rego \nThen load the policy via OPA's REST API.\ncurl -X PUT --data-binary @example.rego \\\n  localhost:8181/v1/policies/example\n\n3. Check that alice can see her own salary.\nThe following command will succeed.\ncurl --user alice:password localhost:5000/finance/salary/alice\n\n4. Check that bob can see alice's salary (because bob is alice's manager.)\ncurl --user bob:password localhost:5000/finance/salary/alice\n\n5. Check that bob CANNOT see charlie's salary.\nbob is not charlie's manager, so the following command will fail.\ncurl --user bob:password localhost:5000/finance/salary/charlie\n\n6. Change the policy.\nSuppose the organization now includes an HR department. The organization wants\nmembers of HR to be able to see any salary. Let's extend the policy to handle\nthis.\ncat >example-hr.rego \nUpload the new policy to OPA.\ncurl -X PUT --data-binary @example-hr.rego \\\n  http://localhost:8181/v1/policies/example-hr\n\nFor the sake of the tutorial we included manager_of and hr data directly\ninside the policies. In real-world scenarios that information would be imported\nfrom external data sources.\n7. Check that the new policy works.\nCheck that david can see anyone's salary.\ncurl --user david:password localhost:5000/finance/salary/alice\ncurl --user david:password localhost:5000/finance/salary/bob\ncurl --user david:password localhost:5000/finance/salary/charlie\ncurl --user david:password localhost:5000/finance/salary/david\n\n8. (Optional) Use JSON Web Tokens to communicate policy data.\nOPA supports the parsing of JSON Web Tokens via the builtin function io.jwt.decode.\nTo get a sense of one way the subordinate and HR data might be communicated in the\nreal world, let's try a similar exercise utilizing the JWT utilities of OPA.\nShut down your docker-compose instance from before with ^C and then restart it to\nensure you are working with a fresh instance of OPA.\nThen update the policy:\ncat >example.rego \nAnd load it into OPA:\ncurl -X PUT --data-binary @example.rego \\\n  localhost:8181/v1/policies/example\n\nFor convenience, we'll want to store user tokens in environment variables (they're really long).\nexport ALICE_TOKEN=\"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VyIjoiYWxpY2UiLCJhenAiOiJhbGljZSIsInN1Ym9yZGluYXRlcyI6W10sImhyIjpmYWxzZX0.rz3jTY033z-NrKfwrK89_dcLF7TN4gwCMj-fVBDyLoM\"\nexport BOB_TOKEN=\"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VyIjoiYm9iIiwiYXpwIjoiYm9iIiwic3Vib3JkaW5hdGVzIjpbImFsaWNlIl0sImhyIjpmYWxzZX0.n_lXN4H8UXGA_fXTbgWRx8b40GXpAGQHWluiYVI9qf0\"\nexport CHARLIE_TOKEN=\"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VyIjoiY2hhcmxpZSIsImF6cCI6ImNoYXJsaWUiLCJzdWJvcmRpbmF0ZXMiOltdLCJociI6ZmFsc2V9.EZd_y_RHUnrCRMuauY7y5a1yiwdUHKRjm9xhVtjNALo\"\nexport BETTY_TOKEN=\"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VyIjoiYmV0dHkiLCJhenAiOiJiZXR0eSIsInN1Ym9yZGluYXRlcyI6WyJjaGFybGllIl0sImhyIjpmYWxzZX0.TGCS6pTzjrs3nmALSOS7yiLO9Bh9fxzDXEDiq1LIYtE\"\nexport DAVID_TOKEN=\"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VyIjoiZGF2aWQiLCJhenAiOiJkYXZpZCIsInN1Ym9yZGluYXRlcyI6W10sImhyIjp0cnVlfQ.Q6EiWzU1wx1g6sdWQ1r4bxT1JgSHUpVXpINMqMaUDMU\"\n\nThese tokens encode the same information as the policies we did before (bob is alice's manager, betty is charlie's, david is the only HR member, etc).\nIf you want to inspect their contents, start up the OPA REPL and execute io.jwt.decode(, [header, payload, signature]).\nLet's try a few queries (note: you may need to escape the ? characters in the queries for your shell):\nCheck that charlie can't see bob's salary.\ncurl --user charlie:password localhost:5000/finance/salary/bob?token=$CHARLIE_TOKEN\n\nCheck that charlie can't pretend to be bob to see alice's salary.\ncurl --user charlie:password localhost:5000/finance/salary/alice?token=$BOB_TOKEN\n\nCheck that david can see betty's salary.\ncurl --user david:password localhost:5000/finance/salary/betty?token=$DAVID_TOKEN\n\nCheck that bob can see alice's salary.\ncurl --user bob:password localhost:5000/finance/salary/alice?token=$BOB_TOKEN\n\nCheck that alice can see her own salary.\ncurl --user alice:password localhost:5000/finance/salary/alice?token=$ALICE_TOKEN\n\nWrap Up\nCongratulations for finishing the tutorial!\nYou learned a number of things about API authorization with OPA:\n\nOPA gives you fine-grained policy control over APIs once you set up the\nserver to ask OPA for authorization.\nYou write allow/deny policies to control which APIs can be executed by whom.\nYou can import external data into OPA and write policies that depend on\nthat data.\nYou can use OPA data structures to define abstractions over your data.\n\nThe code for this tutorial can be found in the\nopen-policy-agent/contrib\nrepository.\n"},"ssh-and-sudo-authorization.html":{"url":"ssh-and-sudo-authorization.html","title":"SSH and sudo Authorization","keywords":"","body":"SSH and sudo Authorization\nHost-level access controls are an important part of every organization's\nsecurity strategy. Using Linux-PAM and OPA\nwe can extend policy-based access control to SSH and sudo.\nGoals\nThis tutorial shows how you can use OPA and Linux-PAM to enforce fine-grained,\nhost-level access controls over SSH and sudo.\nLinux-PAM can be configured to delegate authorization decisions to plugins\n(shared libraries). In this case, we have created an OPA-based plugin that can\nbe configured to authorize SSH and sudo access. The OPA-based Linux-PAM plugin\nused in this tutorial can be found at open-policy-agent/contrib.\nFor this tutorial, our desired policy is:\n\nAdmins can SSH into any host and run sudo commands.\nNormal users can SSH into hosts that they have contributed to and run sudo commands.\n\nFurthermore, we'll assume we have the following set of users and hosts:\n\nfrontend-dev is a developer who contributes to the app running on the frontend host.\nbackend-dev is a developer who contributes to the app running on the backend host.\nops is an administrator for the organization.\n\nAuthentication (verifying user identity) is outside the scope of OPA's\nresponsibility so this tutorial relies on identities being statically\ndefined. In real-world scenarios authentication can be delegated to SSH itself\n(authorized_keys) or other identity management systems.\nLet's get started.\nPrerequisites\nThis tutorial requires Docker Compose to run dummy SSH hosts along\nwith OPA. The dummy SSH hosts are just containers running sshd inside.\nSteps\n1. Bootstrap the tutorial environment using Docker Compose.\nFirst, create a tutorial-docker-compose.yaml file that runs OPA and the containers that\nrepresent our backend and frontend hosts.\ntutorial-docker-compose.yaml:\nversion: '2'\nservices:\n  opa:\n    image: openpolicyagent/opa:0.10.4\n    ports:\n      - 8181:8181\n    # WARNING: OPA is NOT running with an authorization policy configured.

These files are mounted\ninto the containers representing our hosts. The content of the file provides\ncontext that the PAM module provides as input when executing queries\nagainst OPA.\nCreate the extra files required by tutorial-docker-compose.yaml:\necho '{\"host_id\": \"frontend\"}' > frontend_host_id.json\necho '{\"host_id\": \"backend\"}' > backend_host_id.json\n\n\nIn real-world scenarios, these files could contain arbitrary information that we want to expose to the policy.\n\nFinally, run docker-compose to pull and run the containers.\ndocker-compose -f tutorial-docker-compose.yaml up\n\nThis tutorial uses a special Docker image named openpolicyagent/demo-pam to simulate an SSH server.\nThis image contains pre-created Linux accounts for our users, and the required PAM module is\npre-configured inside the sudo and sshd files in /etc/pam.d/.\n2. Load policies and data into OPA.\nIn another terminal, load the policies and data into OPA that will control access to the hosts.\nFirst, create a policy that will tell the PAM module to collect context that is required for authorization.\nFor more details on what this policy should look like, see\nthis documentation.\ncat >pull.rego \nLoad this policy into OPA.\ncurl -X PUT --data-binary @pull.rego \\\n  localhost:8181/v1/policies/pull\n\nNext, create the policies that will authorize SSH and sudo requests.\nThe input which makes up the authorization context in the policy below will also\ninclude some default values, such as the username making the request. See\nthis documentation\nto get a better understanding of what the input to the authorization policy will look like.\nUnlike the pull policy, we'll create separate authz policies\nfor SSH and sudo for more fine-grained control.\nIn production, it makes more sense to have this separation for display and pull as well.\nCreate the SSH authorization policy. It should allow admins to SSH into all hosts,\nand non-admins to only SSH into hosts that they contributed code to.\ncat >sshd_authz.rego \nLoad this policy into OPA.\ncurl -X PUT --data-binary @sshd_authz.rego \\\n  localhost:8181/v1/policies/sshd/authz\n\nCreate the sudo authorization policy. It should allow only admins to use sudo.\ncat >sudo_authz.rego \nLoad this policy into OPA.\ncurl -X PUT --data-binary @sudo_authz.rego \\\n  localhost:8181/v1/policies/sudo/authz\n\nFinally, load the data that represents our roles and contributors into OPA.\ncurl -X PUT localhost:8181/v1/data/roles -d \\\n'{\n    \"admin\": [\"ops\"]\n}'\n\ncurl -X PUT localhost:8181/v1/data/hosts -d \\\n'{\n  \"frontend\": {\n    \"contributors\": [\n      \"frontend-dev\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"backend\": {\n    \"contributors\": [\n      \"backend-dev\"\n    ]\n  }\n}'\n\n3. SSH and sudo as a user with the admin role.\nFirst, let's try to access the hosts as the ops user. Recall, the ops user\nhas been granted the admin role (via the PUT /data/roles request above) and\nusers with the admin role can login to any host and perform sudo commands.\nLogin to the frontend host (which has SSH listening on port 2222) and run a command with sudo as the ops user.\nssh -p 2222 ops@localhost \\\n  -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null\n\nsudo ls /\nexit\n\nYou will see a lot of verbose logs from sudo as the PAM module goes through the motions.\nThis is intended so you can study how the PAM module works.\nYou can disable verbose logging by changing the log_level argument in the PAM\nconfiguration. For more details see\nthis documentation.\n4. SSH as a user without the admin role.\nLet's try a user without the admin role. Recall, that a non-admin user can SSH\ninto any host that they have contributed to.\nThe frontend-dev user contributed code to the frontend host so they should be\nable to login.\nssh -p 2222 frontend-dev@localhost \\\n  -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null\n\nOnly admins can use sudo, so you shouldn't be able to run sudo ls /.\nSince frontend-dev did not contribute to the code running on the\nbackend host (which has SSH listening on port 2223), they should not be able\nto login.\nssh -p 2223 frontend-dev@localhost \\\n  -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null\n\n5. Elevate a user's rights through policy.\nSuppose you have a ticketing system for elevation, where you generate tickets for users\nthat need elevated rights, send the ticket to the user, and expire those tickets when\ntheir rights should be removed.\nLet's mock the current state of this simple ticketing system's API with some data.\ncurl -X PUT localhost:8181/v1/data/elevate -d \\\n'{\n  \"tickets\": {\n    \"frontend-dev\": \"1234\"\n  }\n}'\n\nThis means that for now, if the frontend-dev user can provide ticket number 1234,\nthey should be able to SSH into all servers.\nLet's write policy to ensure that this happens.\nFirst, we need to make the PAM module take input from the user.\ncat >display.rego \nLoad this policy into OPA.\ncurl -X PUT --data-binary @display.rego \\\n  localhost:8181/v1/policies/display\n\nThen we need to make sure that the authorization takes this input into account.\ncat >sudo_authz_elevated.rego \nLoad this policy into OPA.\ncurl -X PUT --data-binary @sudo_authz_elevated.rego \\\n  localhost:8181/v1/policies/sudo_authz_elevated\n\nConfirm that the user frontend-dev can indeed use sudo.\nssh -p 2222 frontend-dev@localhost \\\n  -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null\n\nsudo ls /\n\nYou should be prompted with the message that we defined in our display policy\nfor both the SSH and sudo authorization cycles.\nThis happens because the display policy is shared by the PAM configurations of SSH and sudo.\nIn production, it is more practical to use separate policy packages for each PAM configuration.\nWe have not defined the SSH authz policy to work with elevation, so you can enter any value\ninto the prompt that comes up for for SSH.\nFor sudo, enter the ticket number 1234 to get access.\nLastly, update the mocked elevation API and confirm the user's original rights are restored.\ncurl -X PUT localhost:8181/v1/data/elevate -d \\\n'{\n  \"tickets\": {}\n}'\n\nYou will find that running sudo ls / as the frontend-dev user is disallowed again.\nIt is possible to configure the display policy to only make the PAM module prompt for the\nelevation ticket when our mock API has a non-empty tickets object.

In many deployments,\nadministrators require fine-grained access control over Kafka topics to\nenforce important requirements around confidentiality and integrity.\nGoals\nThis tutorial shows how to enforce fine-grained access control over Kafka\ntopics. In this tutorial you will use OPA to define and enforce an\nauthorization policy stating:\n\nConsumers of topics containing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) must be whitelisted.\nProducers to topics with high fanout must be whitelisted.\n\nIn addition, this tutorial shows how to break up a policy with small helper\nrules to reuse logic and improve overall readability.\nPrerequisites\nThis tutorial requires Docker Compose to run Kafka, ZooKeeper, and OPA.\nSteps\n1. Bootstrap the tutorial environment using Docker Compose.\nFirst, create an OPA policy that allows all requests. You will update this policy later in the tutorial.\nmkdir -p policies\n\npolicies/tutorial.rego:\npackage kafka.authz\n\nallow = true\n\nNext, create a docker-compose.yaml file that runs OPA, ZooKeeper, and Kafka.\ndocker-compose.yaml:\nversion: \"2\"\nservices:\n  opa:\n    hostname: opa\n    image: openpolicyagent/opa:0.10.4\n    ports:\n      - 8181:8181\n    # WARNING: OPA is NOT running with an authorization policy configured.

Enabling SSL client authentication\nallows for service identities to be provided as input to your policy. The\nexample below shows the input structure.\n{\n  \"operation\": {\n    \"name\": \"Write\",\n  },\n  \"resource\": {\n    \"resourceType\": {\n      \"name\": \"Topic\",\n    },\n    \"name\": \"credit-scores\"\n  },\n  \"session\": {\n    \"principal\": {\n      \"principalType\": \"User\",\n    },\n    \"clientAddress\": \"172.21.0.5\",\n    \"sanitizedUser\": \"CN%3Danon_producer.tutorial.openpolicyagent.org%2COU%3DTUTORIAL%2CO%3DOPA%2CL%3DSF%2CST%3DCA%2CC%3DUS\"\n  }\n}\n\nThe client identity is extracted from the SSL certificates that clients\npresent when they connect to the broker. The client identity information is\nencoded in the input.session.sanitizedUser field. This field can be decoded\ninside the policy.\nGenerating SSL certificates and JKS files required for SSL client\nauthentication is outside the scope of this tutorial. To simplify the steps\nbelow, the Docker Compose file uses an extended version of the\nconfluentinc/cp-kafka\nimage from Docker Hub. The extended image includes pre-generated SSL\ncertificates that the broker and clients use to identify themselves.\nDo not rely on these pre-generated SSL certificates in real-world scenarios.\nThey are only provided for convenience/test purposes.\nKafka Authorizer JAR File\nThe Kafka image used in this tutorial includes a pre-installed JAR file that implements the Kafka Authorizer interface. For more information on the authorizer see open-policy-agent/contrib/kafka_authorizer.\n2. Define a policy to restrict consumer access to topics containing Personally Identifiable Information (PII).\nUpdate the policies/tutorial.rego with the following content.\n#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n# High level policy for controlling access to Kafka.\n#\n# * Deny operations by default.\n# * Allow operations if no explicit denial.\n#\n# The kafka-authorizer-opa plugin will query OPA for decisions at\n# /kafka/authz/allow.

Exercise the policy that restricts consumer access to topics containing PII.\nThis step shows how you can grant fine-grained access to services using\nKafka. In this scenario, some services are allowed to read PII data while\nothers are not.\nFirst, run kafka-console-producer to generate some data on the\ncredit-scores topic.\n\nThis tutorial uses the kafka-console-producer and kafka-console-consumer scripts to generate and display Kafka messages. These scripts read from STDIN and write to STDOUT and are frequently used to send and receive data via Kafka over the command line. If you are not familiar with these scripts you can learn more in Kafka's Quick Start documentation.\n\ndocker run --rm --network opakafkatutorial_default \\\n    openpolicyagent/demo-kafka:1.0 \\\n    bash -c 'for i in {1..10}; do echo \"{\\\"user\\\": \\\"bob\\\", \\\"score\\\": $i}\"; done | kafka-console-producer --topic credit-scores --broker-list kafka:9093 -producer.config /etc/kafka/secrets/anon_producer.ssl.config'\n\nThis command will send 10 messages to the credit-scores topic. Bob's credit\nscore seems to be improving.\nNext, run kafka-console-consumer and try to read data off the topic. Use\nthe pii_consumer credentials to simulate a service that is allowed to read\nPII data.\ndocker run --rm --network opakafkatutorial_default \\\n    openpolicyagent/demo-kafka:1.0 \\\n    kafka-console-consumer --bootstrap-server kafka:9093 --topic credit-scores --from-beginning --consumer.config /etc/kafka/secrets/pii_consumer.ssl.config\n\nThis command will output the 10 messages sent to the topic in the first part\nof this step. Once the 10 messages have been printed, exit out of the script\n(^C).\nFinally, run kafka-console-consumer again but this time try to use the\nanon_consumer credentials. The anon_consumer credentials simulate a\nservice that has not been explicitly granted access to PII data.\ndocker run --rm --network opakafkatutorial_default \\\n    openpolicyagent/demo-kafka:1.0 \\\n    kafka-console-consumer --bootstrap-server kafka:9093 --topic credit-scores --from-beginning --consumer.config /etc/kafka/secrets/anon_consumer.ssl.config\n\nBecause the anon_consumer is not allowed to read PII data, the request will\nbe denied and the consumer will output an error message.\nNot authorized to read from topic credit-scores.\n...\nProcessed a total of 0 messages\n4. Extend the policy to prevent services from accidentally writing to topics with large fanout.\nFirst, add the following content to the policy file (./policies/tutorial.rego):\ndeny {\n  is_write_operation\n  topic_has_large_fanout\n  not producer_is_whitelisted_for_large_fanout\n}\n\nproducer_whitelist = {\n  \"large-fanout\": {\n    \"fanout_producer\",\n  }\n}\n\ntopic_has_large_fanout {\n  topic_metadata[topic_name].tags[_] == \"large-fanout\"\n}\n\nproducer_is_whitelisted_for_large_fanout {\n  producer_whitelist[\"large-fanout\"][_] == principal.name\n}\n\nNext, update the topic_metadata data structure in the same file to indicate\nthat the click-stream topic has a high fanout.\ntopic_metadata = {\n  \"click-stream\": {\n    \"tags\": [\"large-fanout\"],\n  },\n  \"credit-scores\": {\n    \"tags\": [\"pii\"],\n  }\n}\n\n5. Exercise the policy that restricts producer access to topics with high fanout.\nFirst, run kafka-console-producer and simulate a service with access to the\nclick-stream topic.\ndocker run --rm --network opakafkatutorial_default \\\n    openpolicyagent/demo-kafka:1.0 \\\n    bash -c 'for i in {1..10}; do echo \"{\\\"user\\\": \\\"alice\\\", \\\"button\\\": $i}\"; done | kafka-console-producer --topic click-stream --broker-list kafka:9093 -producer.config /etc/kafka/secrets/fanout_producer.ssl.config'\n\nNext, run the kafka-console-consumer to confirm that the messages were published.\ndocker run --rm --network opakafkatutorial_default \\\n    openpolicyagent/demo-kafka:1.0 \\\n    kafka-console-consumer --bootstrap-server kafka:9093 --topic click-stream --from-beginning --consumer.config /etc/kafka/secrets/anon_consumer.ssl.config\n\nOnce you see the 10 messages produced by the first part of this step, exit the console consumer (^C).\nLastly, run kafka-console-producer to simulate a service that should not\nhave access to high fanout topics.\ndocker run --rm --network opakafkatutorial_default \\\n    openpolicyagent/demo-kafka:1.0 \\\n    bash -c 'echo \"{\\\"user\\\": \\\"alice\\\", \\\"button\\\": \\\"bogus\\\"}\" | kafka-console-producer --topic click-stream --broker-list kafka:9093 -producer.config /etc/kafka/secrets/anon_producer.ssl.config'\n\nBecause anon_producer is not authorized to write to high fanout topics, the\nrequest will be denied and the producer will output an error message.\nNot authorized to access topics: [click-stream]\nWrap Up\nCongratulations for finishing the tutorial!\nAt this point you have learned how to enforce fine-grained access control\nover Kafka topics. In addition, you have seen how to break down policies into\nsmaller rules that can be reused and improve the overall readability over the\npolicy.\nIf you want to use the Kafka Authorizer plugin that integrates Kafka with\nOPA, see the build and install instructions in the\ngithub.com/open-policy-agent/contrib\nrepository.\n"},"kubernetes-admission-control.html":{"url":"kubernetes-admission-control.html","title":"Kubernetes Admission Control","keywords":"","body":"Kubernetes Admission Control\nIn Kubernetes, Admission Controllers enforce semantic validation of objects during create, update, and delete operations.

You can configure the sidecar to load any kind of Kubernetes object into OPA. The sidecar establishes watches on the Kubernetes API server so that OPA has access to an eventually consistent cache of Kubernetes objects.\nNext, generate the manifest that will be used to register OPA as an admission controller:\ncat > webhook-configuration.yaml \nThe generated configuration file includes a base64 encoded representation of the CA certificate so that TLS connections can be established between the Kubernetes API server and OPA.\nFinally, register OPA as an admission controller:\nkubectl apply -f webhook-configuration.yaml\n\nYou can follow the OPA logs to see the webhook requests being issued by the Kubernetes API server:\nkubectl logs -l app=opa -c opa\n4. Define a policy and load it into OPA via Kubernetes\nTo test admission control, create a policy that restricts the hostnames that an ingress can use (ingress-whitelist.rego):\npackage kubernetes.admission\n\nimport data.kubernetes.namespaces\n\ndeny[msg] {\n    input.request.kind.kind = \"Ingress\"\n    input.request.operation = \"CREATE\"\n    host = input.request.object.spec.rules[_].host\n    not fqdn_matches_any(host, valid_ingress_hosts)\n    msg = sprintf(\"invalid ingress host %q\", [host])\n}\n\nvalid_ingress_hosts = {host |\n    whitelist = namespaces[input.request.namespace].metadata.annotations[\"ingress-whitelist\"]\n    hosts = split(whitelist, \",\")\n    host = hosts[_]\n}\n\nfqdn_matches_any(str, patterns) {\n    fqdn_matches(str, patterns[_])\n}\n\nfqdn_matches(str, pattern) {\n    pattern_parts = split(pattern, \".\")\n    pattern_parts[0] = \"*\"\n    str_parts = split(str, \".\")\n    n_pattern_parts = count(pattern_parts)\n    n_str_parts = count(str_parts)\n    suffix = trim(pattern, \"*.\")\n    endswith(str, suffix)\n}\n\nfqdn_matches(str, pattern) {\n    not contains(pattern, \"*\")\n    str = pattern\n}\n\n\nStore the policy in Kubernetes as a ConfigMap. By default kube-mgmt will try to load policies out of configmaps in the opa namespace OR configmaps in other namespaces labelled openpolicyagent.org/policy=rego.\nkubectl create configmap ingress-whitelist --from-file=ingress-whitelist.rego\n\nThe OPA sidecar will notice the ConfigMap and automatically load the policy into OPA.\n5. Exercise the policy\nCreate two new namespaces to test the Ingress policy.\nqa-namespace.yaml:\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Namespace\nmetadata:\n  annotations:\n    ingress-whitelist: \"*.qa.acmecorp.com,*.internal.acmecorp.com\"\n  name: qa\n\nproduction-namespace.yaml:\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Namespace\nmetadata:\n  annotations:\n    ingress-whitelist: \"*.acmecorp.com\"\n  name: production\n\nkubectl create -f qa-namespace.yaml\nkubectl create -f production-namespace.yaml\n\nNext, define two Ingress objects.

Modify the policy and exercise the changes\nOPA allows you to modify policies on-the-fly without recompiling any of the services that offload policy decisions to it.\nTo enforce the second half of the policy from the start of this tutorial you can load another policy into OPA that prevents Ingress objects in different namespaces from sharing the same hostname.\ningress-conflicts.rego:\npackage kubernetes.admission\n\nimport data.kubernetes.ingresses\n\ndeny[msg] {\n    input.request.kind.kind = \"Ingress\"\n    input.request.operation = \"CREATE\"\n    host = input.request.object.spec.rules[_].host\n    ingress = ingresses[other_ns][other_ingress]\n    other_ns != input.request.namespace\n    ingress.spec.rules[_].host = host\n    msg = sprintf(\"invalid ingress host %q (conflicts with %v/%v)\", [host, other_ns, other_ingress])\n}\n\n\nkubectl create configmap ingress-conflicts --from-file=ingress-conflicts.rego\n\nThe OPA sidecar annotates ConfigMaps containing policies to indicate if they\nwere installed successfully. Verify that the ConfigMap was installed successfully:\nkubectl get configmap ingress-conflicts -o yaml\nTest that you cannot create an Ingress in another namespace with the same hostname as the one created earlier.\nstaging-namespace.yaml:\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Namespace\nmetadata:\n  annotations:\n    ingress-whitelist: \"*.acmecorp.com\"\n  name: staging\nkubectl create -f staging-namespace.yaml\n\nkubectl create -f ingress-ok.yaml -n staging\n\nWrap Up\nCongratulations for finishing the tutorial!\nThis tutorial showed how you can leverage OPA to enforce admission control\ndecisions in Kubernetes clusters without modifying or recompiling any\nKubernetes components.

Contributions welcome!)\nSteps\n1. Create and save a Terraform plan\nCreate a Terraform file that includes an\nauto-scaling group and a server on AWS.  (You will need to modify the shared_credentials_file\nto point to your AWS credentials.)\ncat >main.tf \nThen ask Terraform to calculate what changes it will make and store the output in plan.binary.\nterraform plan --out tfplan.binary\n\n2. Convert the Terraform plan into JSON\nUse the tfjson tool to convert the Terraform plan into JSON so that OPA can read the plan.\ntfjson tfplan.binary > tfplan.json\n\nHere is the expected contents of tfplan.json.\n{\n    \"aws_autoscaling_group.my_asg\": {\n        \"arn\": \"\",\n        \"availability_zones.#\": \"1\",\n        \"availability_zones.3205754986\": \"us-west-1a\",\n        \"default_cooldown\": \"\",\n        \"desired_capacity\": \"4\",\n        \"destroy\": false,\n        \"destroy_tainted\": false,\n        \"force_delete\": \"true\",\n        \"health_check_grace_period\": \"300\",\n        \"health_check_type\": \"ELB\",\n        \"id\": \"\",\n        \"launch_configuration\": \"my_web_config\",\n        \"load_balancers.#\": \"\",\n        \"max_size\": \"5\",\n        \"metrics_granularity\": \"1Minute\",\n        \"min_size\": \"1\",\n        \"name\": \"my_asg\",\n        \"protect_from_scale_in\": \"false\",\n        \"vpc_zone_identifier.#\": \"\",\n        \"wait_for_capacity_timeout\": \"10m\"\n    },\n    \"aws_instance.web\": {\n        \"ami\": \"ami-09b4b74c\",\n        \"associate_public_ip_address\": \"\",\n        \"availability_zone\": \"\",\n        \"destroy\": false,\n        \"destroy_tainted\": false,\n        \"ebs_block_device.#\": \"\",\n        \"ephemeral_block_device.#\": \"\",\n        \"id\": \"\",\n        \"instance_state\": \"\",\n        \"instance_type\": \"t2.micro\",\n        \"ipv6_addresses.#\": \"\",\n        \"key_name\": \"\",\n        \"network_interface_id\": \"\",\n        \"placement_group\": \"\",\n        \"private_dns\": \"\",\n        \"private_ip\": \"\",\n        \"public_dns\": \"\",\n        \"public_ip\": \"\",\n        \"root_block_device.#\": \"\",\n        \"security_groups.#\": \"\",\n        \"source_dest_check\": \"true\",\n        \"subnet_id\": \"\",\n        \"tenancy\": \"\",\n        \"vpc_security_group_ids.#\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"aws_launch_configuration.my_web_config\": {\n        \"associate_public_ip_address\": \"false\",\n        \"destroy\": false,\n        \"destroy_tainted\": false,\n        \"ebs_block_device.#\": \"\",\n        \"ebs_optimized\": \"\",\n        \"enable_monitoring\": \"true\",\n        \"id\": \"\",\n        \"image_id\": \"ami-09b4b74c\",\n        \"instance_type\": \"t2.micro\",\n        \"key_name\": \"\",\n        \"name\": \"my_web_config\",\n        \"root_block_device.#\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"destroy\": false\n}\n3. Write the OPA policy to check the plan\nThe policy computes a score for a Terraform that combines\n\nThe number of deletions of each resource type\nThe number of creations of each resource type\nThe number of modifications of each resource type\n\nThe policy authorizes the plan when the score for the plan is below a threshold\nand there are no changes made to any IAM resources.\n(For simplicity, the threshold in this tutorial is the same for everyone, but in\npractice you would vary the threshold depending on the user.)\nterraform.rego:\npackage terraform.analysis\n\nimport input as tfplan\n\n########################\n# Parameters for Policy\n########################\n\n# acceptable score for automated authorization\nblast_radius = 30\n\n# weights assigned for each operation on each resource-type\nweights = {\n    \"aws_autoscaling_group\": {\"delete\": 100, \"create\": 10, \"modify\": 1},\n    \"aws_instance\": {\"delete\": 10, \"create\": 1, \"modify\": 1}\n}\n\n# Consider exactly these resource types in calculations\nresource_types = {\"aws_autoscaling_group\", \"aws_instance\", \"aws_iam\", \"aws_launch_configuration\"}\n\n#########\n# Policy\n#########\n\n# Authorization holds if score for the plan is acceptable and no changes are made to IAM\ndefault authz = false\nauthz {\n    score  0\n}\n\n####################\n# Terraform Library\n####################\n\n# list of all resources of a given type\ninstance_names[resource_type] = all {\n    resource_types[resource_type]\n    all := [name |\n        tfplan[name] = _\n        startswith(name, resource_type)\n    ]\n}\n\n# number of deletions of resources of a given type\nnum_deletes[resource_type] = num {\n    resource_types[resource_type]\n    all := instance_names[resource_type]\n    deletions = [name | name := all[_]; tfplan[name][\"destroy\"] = true]\n    num := count(deletions)\n}\n\n# number of creations of resources of a given type\nnum_creates[resource_type] = num {\n    resource_types[resource_type]\n    all := instance_names[resource_type]\n    creates = [name | all[_] = name; tfplan[name][\"id\"] = \"\"]\n    num := count(creates)\n}\n\n# number of modifications to resources of a given type\nnum_modifies[resource_type] = num {\n    resource_types[resource_type]\n    all := instance_names[resource_type]\n    modifies := [name | name := all[_]; obj := tfplan[name]; obj[\"destroy\"] = false; not obj[\"id\"]]\n    num := count(modifies)\n}\n\n4. Evaluate the OPA policy on the Terraform plan\nTo evaluate the policy against that plan, you hand OPA the policy, the Terraform plan as input, and\nask it to evaluate data.terraform.analysis.authz.\nopa eval --data terraform.rego --input tfplan.json \"data.terraform.analysis.authz\"\n\nIf you're curious, you can ask for the score that the policy used to make the authorization decision.\nIn our example, it is 11 (10 for the creation of the auto-scaling group and 1 for the creation of the server).\nopa eval --data terraform.rego --input tfplan.json \"data.terraform.analysis.score\"\n\nIf as suggested in the previous step, you want to modify your policy to make an authorization decision\nbased on both the user and the Terraform plan, the input you would give to OPA would take the form\n{\"user\": , \"plan\": }, and your policy would reference the user with input.user and\nthe plan with input.plan.  You could even go so far as to provide the Terraform state file and the AWS\nEC2 data to OPA and write policy using all of that context.\n5. Create a Large Terraform plan and Evaluate it\nCreate a Terraform plan that creates enough resources to exceed the blast-radius permitted\nby policy.\ncat >main.tf \nGenerate the Terraform plan and convert it to JSON.\nterraform plan --out tfplan_large.binary\ntfjson tfplan_large.binary > tfplan_large.json\n\nEvaluate the policy to see that it fails the policy tests and check the score.\nopa eval --data terraform.rego --input tfplan_large.json \"data.terraform.analysis.authz\"\nopa eval --data terraform.rego --input tfplan_large.json \"data.terraform.analysis.score\"\n\n6. (Optional) Run OPA as a daemon and evaluate policy\nIn addition to running OPA from the command-line, you can run it as a daemon loaded with the Terraform policy and\nthen interact with it using its HTTP API.  First, start the daemon:\nopa run -s terraform.rego\n\nThen in a separate terminal, use OPA's HTTP API to evaluate the policy against the two Terraform plans.\ncurl localhost:8181/v0/data/terraform/analysis/authz -d @tfplan.json\ncurl localhost:8181/v0/data/terraform/analysis/authz -d @tfplan_large.json\n\nWrap Up\nCongratulations for finishing the tutorial!\nYou learned a number of things about Terraform Testing with OPA:\n\nOPA gives you fine-grained policy control over Terraform plans.\nYou can use data other than the plan itself (e.g. the user) when writing authorization policies.\n\nKeep in mind that it's up to you to decide how to use OPA's Terraform tests and authorization decision.  Here are some ideas.\n\nAdd it as part of your Terraform wrapper to implement unit tests on Terraform plans\nUse it to automatically approve run-of-the-mill Terraform changes to reduce the burden of peer-review\nEmbed it into your deployment system to catch problems that arise when applying Terraform to production after applying it to staging\n\n"},"ceph-authorization.html":{"url":"ceph-authorization.html","title":"Ceph Authorization","keywords":"","body":"Ceph Authorization\nCeph is a highly scalable distributed storage solution that uniquely delivers object, block, and file storage in one unified system. You can enforce fine-grained authorization over Ceph's Object Storage using OPA. Ceph's Object Storage essentially consists of a Ceph Storage Cluster and a Ceph Object Gateway.\nThe Ceph Object Gateway is an object storage interface built on top of librados to provide applications with a RESTful gateway to Ceph Storage Clusters.\nOPA is integrated with the Ceph Object Gateway daemon (RGW), which is an HTTP server that interacts with a Ceph Storage Cluster and provides interfaces compatible with OpenStack Swift and Amazon S3.\nWhen the Ceph Object Gateway gets a request, it checks with OPA whether the request should be allowed or not. OPA makes a decision (allow or deny) based on the policies and data it has access to and sends the decision back to the Ceph Object Gateway for enforcement.\nGoals\nThis tutorial shows how to enforce custom policies over the S3 API to the Ceph Storage Cluster which applications use to put and get data.\nThis tutorial uses Rook to run Ceph inside a Kubernetes cluster.\nPrerequisites\nThis tutorial requires Kubernetes 1.9 or later. To run the tutorial locally, we recommend using minikube in version v0.28+ with Kubernetes 1.10 (which is the default).\nSteps\n1. Start Minikube\nminikube start\n\n2.

Understanding the OPA policy\nAs we saw earlier, the OPA spec contained a ConfigMap that defined the policy to be used to authorize requests received by the Ceph Object Gateway. Below is the policy:\nauthz.rego\npackage ceph.authz\n\ndefault allow = false\n\n#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n# Data structures containing location info about users and buckets.\n# In real-world deployments, these data structures could be loaded into\n# OPA as raw JSON data. The JSON data could also be pulled from external\n# sources like AD, Git, etc.\n#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# user-location information\nuser_location = {\n    \"alice\": \"UK\",\n    \"bob\":   \"USA\"\n}\n\n# bucket-location information\nbucket_location = {\n    \"supersecretbucket\": \"USA\"\n}\n\n# Allow access to bucket in same location as user.\nallow {\n    input.method = \"HEAD\"\n    is_user_in_bucket_location(input.user_info.user_id, input.bucket_info.bucket.name)\n}\n\nallow {\n    input.method = \"GET\"\n}\n\nallow {\n    input.method = \"PUT\"\n    input.user_info.display_name = \"Bob\"\n}\n\nallow {\n    input.method = \"DELETE\"\n    input.user_info.display_name = \"Bob\"\n}\n\n# Check if the user and the bucket being accessed belong to the same\n# location.\nis_user_in_bucket_location(user, bucket) {\n    user_location[user] == bucket_location[bucket]\n}\n\nThe above policy will restrict a user from accessing a bucket whose location does not match the user's location.. The user's and bucket's location is hardcoded in the policy for simplicity and in the real-world can be fetched from external sources or pushed into OPA using it's REST API.\nIn the above policy, Bob's location is USA while Alice's is UK. Since the bucket supersecretbucket is located in the USA, Alice should not be able to access it.\n9. Create the S3 access test script\nThe below Python S3 access test script connects to the  Ceph Object Store Gateway to perform actions such as creating and deleting buckets. \n\nYou will need to install the python-boto package to run the test script.\n\nSave the test script as s3test.py:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nimport sys\nimport boto.s3.connection\nfrom boto.s3.key import Key\nimport os\n\n\ndef create_bucket(conn, bucket_name):\n    try:\n        bucket = conn.create_bucket(bucket_name)\n    except Exception as e:\n        print 'Unable to create bucket: Forbidden'\n\n\ndef delete_bucket(conn, bucket_name):\n    try:\n        bucket = conn.delete_bucket(bucket_name)\n    except Exception as e:\n        print 'Unable to delete bucket: Forbidden'\n\n\ndef list_bucket(conn):\n    buckets = conn.get_all_buckets()\n    if len(buckets) == 0:\n        print 'No Buckets'\n        return\n    for bucket in buckets:\n        print \"{name} {created}\".format(\n            name=bucket.name,\n            created=bucket.creation_date,\n    )\n\n\ndef upload_data(conn, bucket_name, data):\n    bucket = conn.get_bucket(bucket_name)\n    k = Key(bucket)\n    k.key = 'foobar'\n    k.set_contents_from_string(data)\n\n\ndef download_data(conn, user, bucket_name):\n    try:\n        bucket = conn.get_bucket(bucket_name)\n    except Exception as e:\n        print 'Not allowed to access bucket \"{}\": User \"{}\" not in the same location as bucket \"{}\"'.format(bucket_name, user, bucket_name)\n    else:\n        k = Key(bucket)\n        k.key = 'foobar'\n        print k.get_contents_as_string()\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    user = sys.argv[1]\n    action = sys.argv[2]\n\n    if len(sys.argv) == 4:\n        bucket_name = sys.argv[3]\n\n    if len(sys.argv) == 5:\n        bucket_name = sys.argv[3]\n        data = sys.argv[4]\n\n    access_key_env_name = '{}_ACCESS_KEY'.format(user.upper())\n    secret_key_env_name = '{}_SECRET_KEY'.format(user.upper())\n\n    access_key = os.getenv(access_key_env_name)\n    secret_key = os.getenv(secret_key_env_name)\n\n    conn = boto.connect_s3(\n            aws_access_key_id=access_key,\n            aws_secret_access_key=secret_key,\n            host=os.getenv(\"HOST\"), port=int(os.getenv(\"PORT\")),\n            is_secure=False, calling_format=boto.s3.connection.OrdinaryCallingFormat(),\n    )\n\n    if action == 'create':\n            create_bucket(conn, bucket_name)\n\n    if action == 'list':\n            list_bucket(conn)\n\n    if action == 'delete':\n            delete_bucket(conn, bucket_name)\n\n    if action == 'upload_data':\n        upload_data(conn, bucket_name, data)\n\n    if action == 'download_data':\n        download_data(conn, user, bucket_name)\n\nThe script needs the following environment variables:\n\nHOST - Hostname of the machine running the RGW service in the cluster.\nPORT - Port of the RGW service.\n_ACCESS_KEY - USER's ACCESS_KEY\n_SECRET_KEY - USER's SECRET_KEY\n\nWe previously created a service to provide external access to the RGW.\n$ kubectl -n rook-ceph get service rook-ceph-rgw-my-store-external\nNAME                              TYPE       CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE\nrook-ceph-rgw-my-store-external   NodePort   10.111.198.148           80:31765/TCP   2h\n\nInternally the RGW service is running on port 80. The external port in this case is 31765.\nSet the HOST and PORT environment variables:\nexport HOST=$(minikube ip)\nexport PORT=$(kubectl -n rook-ceph get service rook-ceph-rgw-my-store-external -o jsonpath='{.spec.ports[?(@.name==\"rgw\")].nodePort}')\n\nGet Alice's and Bob's ACCESS_KEY and SECRET_KEY from the Kubernetes Secret and set the following environment variables:\nexport ALICE_ACCESS_KEY=$(kubectl get secret rook-ceph-object-user-my-store-alice -n rook-ceph -o yaml | grep AccessKey | awk '{print $2}' | base64 --decode)\nexport ALICE_SECRET_KEY=$(kubectl get secret rook-ceph-object-user-my-store-alice -n rook-ceph -o yaml | grep SecretKey | awk '{print $2}' | base64 --decode)\nexport BOB_ACCESS_KEY=$(kubectl get secret rook-ceph-object-user-my-store-bob -n rook-ceph -o yaml | grep AccessKey | awk '{print $2}' | base64 --decode)\nexport BOB_SECRET_KEY=$(kubectl get secret rook-ceph-object-user-my-store-bob -n rook-ceph -o yaml | grep SecretKey | awk '{print $2}' | base64 --decode)\n\nNow let's create a bucket and add some data to it.\n\nFirst, Bob creates a bucket supersecretbucket\n  python s3test.py Bob create supersecretbucket\n\n\nList the bucket just created\n  python s3test.py Bob list\n\n  The output will be something like:\n  supersecretbucket 2019-01-14T21:18:03.872Z\n\n\nAdd some data to the bucket supersecretbucket\n  python s3test.py Bob upload_data supersecretbucket \"This is some secret data\"\n\n\n\n10. Exercise the OPA policy\nTo recap, the policy we are going to test will restrict a user from accessing a bucket whose location does not match the user's location..\nCheck that Alice cannot access the contents of the bucket supersecretbucket.\npython s3test.py Alice download_data supersecretbucket\n\nSince Alice is located in UK and and the bucket supersecretbucket in the USA, she would be denied access.\nCheck that Bob can access the contents of the bucket supersecretbucket.\npython s3test.py Bob download_data supersecretbucket\n\nSince Bob and the bucket supersecretbucket are both located in the USA, Bob is granted access to the contents in the bucket.\nWrap Up\nCongratulations for finishing the tutorial!\nThis tutorial showed how OPA can be used to enforce custom policies over the S3 API to the Ceph Storage Cluster. You can modify OPA's polices to get greater control over the actions performed on the Ceph Object Storage without making any changes to Ceph.\nThis tutorial also showed how OPA can seamlessly work with Rook without any modifications to Rook's components.\n"},"best-practice-identity.html":{"url":"best-practice-identity.html","title":"Identity and User attributes","keywords":"","body":"Best Practices: Identity and User Attributes\nA common question from OPA users is how to deal with identity and user attributes.  The first thing to keep in mind is that OPA does not handle authentication.  It does not help users prove they are who they say they are; it does not handle usernames and passwords, or issue TLS certificates.  OPA assumes you have authentication in place and helps you with the step after that: authorization and policy--controlling who can do what.\nOf course, identity and user attribute information is crucial to answering who can do what.  In fact, whenever possible you should write policy in terms of user attributes (e.g. group membership) instead of individual users.  Otherwise, policies become brittle and require updates every time an individual (or software system) joins or leaves the organization.  For example, you might grant higher privileges to people in engineering and currently on-call; then independently you can modify people's attributes without having to change policy.\nTo evaluate policies written using user attributes, OPA needs a way to figure out what the appropriate user attributes for each decision it makes.  Often those user attributes are stored in LDAP or ActiveDirectory (AD).  This document describes best-practices for providing LDAP/AD information to OPA.\nBelow we detail different ways to make LDAP/AD information available to OPA.  You should prefer earlier options in the list to later options, but in the end the right choice depends on your situation.\n1. JWT Tokens\nJSON Web Tokens (JWTs) allow you to securely transmit JSON data between software systems and are often produced during the authentication process.  You can set up authentication so that when the user logs in you create a JWT with that user's LDAP/AD data.  Then you hand that JWT to OPA and use OPA's specialized support for JWTs to extract the information you need to make a policy decision.\nFlow\nThe following diagram shows this process in more detail.\n\nUser logs in to LDAP/AD\nThe user is given a JWT token encoding group membership and other user attributes that are stored in LDAP/AD\nThe user provides that JWT token to an OPA-enabled software system for authentication\nThe OPA-enabled software system includes that token as part of the usual input to OPA.\nOPA decodes the JWT token and uses the contents to make policy decisions.\n\n\nUpdates\nThe JWT only gets refreshed when the user authenticates; how often that happens is up to the TTL included in the token.  When LDAP/AD information changes, those changes will not be seen by OPA until the user authenticates and gets a new JWT.\nSize Limitations\nJWTs have a limited size in practice, so if your organization has too many user attributes you may not be able to fit all the required information into a JWT.\nSecurity\n\nOPA includes primitives to verify the signature of JWT tokens.\nOPA let's you check the TTL.\nOPA has early support for making HTTP requests during evaluation, which could be used to check if a JWT has been revoked.  Though if you're connecting to a remote system on every policy decision anyway, you should think about whether connecting to LDAP/AD directly is more appropriate (see below).\n\n2. Downloading LDAP/AD data as part of a policy bundle\nJWTs may not be available to you.  Or perhaps your policies require information about a user other than the one performing the action that OPA is authorizing.\nFor example, suppose your policy says a resource's owner or anyone in the owner's group may modify that resource.  When Alice tries to modify a resource she doesn't own, OPA would need to find the owner and check if Alice belongs to the same group as the owner.  But if OPA only has Alice's JWT token, it does not know what groups the resource's owner belong to.\nIn any case, another option is to replicate LDAP/AD data in bulk into OPA.  One way to do that is through OPA's bundle feature, which periodically downloads policy bundles from a centralized server.  Those bundles can include data as well as policy.  If you implement the centralized server, you can include LDAP/AD data within the bundle.  Then every time OPA gets updated policies, it gets updated LDAP/AD data too.\nFlow\nTwo things happen independently with this kind of LDAP/AD integration.\n\n(1) OPA downloads new policy bundles including LDAP/AD\n(A) OPA-enabled software system asks OPA for policy decisions\n\n\nUpdates\nThe lag between an LDAP/AD update and OPA having the update is the sum of the lag for an update between LDAP/AD and the central server and the lag for an update between the central server an OPA.  So if LDAP/AD updates every 5 minutes, and OPA pulls an update every 2 minutes, then the total maximum lag is 7 minutes.  Unlike the JWT case, it is feasible that a user could perform an action requiring authorization on the OPA-enabled service before OPA has the appropriate LDAP/AD policy, but you can account for that when writing policy and reject any request when there is insufficient data.\nSize limitations\nUnlike the JWT case, where OPA only stores 1 user's LDAP/AD data at a time, when synchronizing LDAP/AD, OPA stores all users' LDAP/AD data at once in memory.  Obviously this can be a problem with large LDAP/AD stores.  Because the centralized server handles both policy and data it could provide just the LDAP/AD data necessary for the policies.\n\n3. Pushing LDAP/AD into OPA\nAnother way to replicate LDAP/AD data into OPA is to use OPA's API for injecting arbitrary JSON data.  You can build a synchronizer that pulls information out of LDAP/AD and pushes that information in OPA through its API.  This approach would be useful if you are not using the bundle API, or you need to optimize for update latency.\nFlow\nTwo things happen independently with this kind of LDAP/AD integration.\n\n(1) Synchronizer keeps OPA up to date with LDAP/AD\n(A) OPA-enabled software system asks OPA for policy decisions\n\n\nUpdates\nThe total lag between LDAP/AD being updated and OPA being updated is the sum of the lag for an update between LDAP/AD and the synchronizer plus the lag for an update between the synchronizer and OPA.  Unlike the JWT case, it is feasible that a user could perform an action requiring authorization on the OPA-enabled service before OPA has the appropriate LDAP/AD policy, but you can account for that when writing policy and reject any request when there is insufficient data.\nSize limitations\nUnlike the JWT case, where OPA only stores 1 user's LDAP/AD data at a time, when synchronizing LDAP/AD, OPA stores all users' LDAP/AD data at once in memory.  Obviously this can be a problem with large LDAP/AD stores.\n\n4. Pull from LDAP/AD during evaluation\nOPA has experimental capabilities for reaching out to external servers during evaluation.  This functionality handles those cases where there is too much data to synchronize into OPA, JWTs are ineffective, or policy requires information that must be as up to date as possible.\nThat functionality is implemented as OPA builtins.  Check the docs for the latest instructions.\nCurrent limitations\n\nUnit test framework does not allow you to mock out the results of builtin functions\nAny credentials that are needed for the external service must be hardcoded into the policy.\nThere has been discussion around adding a builtin that pulls information out of the environment so that OPA can be configured with credentials.\n\n\n\nFlow\nThe key difference here is that every decision requires contacting LDAP/AD.  If that service or the network connection is slow or unavailable, OPA may not be able to return a decision.\n\nOPA-enabled service asks OPA for a decision\nOPA during evaluation asks LDAP/AD for user attributes\n\n\nUpdates\nLDAP/AD data is perfectly fresh.  There is no lag between an update to LDAP/AD and when OPA sees that update.\nSize limitations\nOnly the data actually needed by the policy is pulled from LDAP/AD.  There is no need for a synchronizer to figure out what data the policy will need before execution. It is possible to gather multiple users' attributes\nPerformance and Availability\nLatency and availability of decision-making are dependent on the network.  This approach may still be superior to running OPA on a remote server entirely because a local OPA can make some decisions without going over the network--those decisions that do not require information from the remote LDAP/AD server.\n5.
